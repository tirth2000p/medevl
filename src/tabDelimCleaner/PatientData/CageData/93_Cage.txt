S:  CC: "I had chest pain" HPI: Mr. Cage is a 46 yo M with history of HTN who presents after having an episode of substernal, dull chest pain 4 days ago while carrying groceries to his car. The pain started abruptly, "knocked the wind out of him", and was associated with some dizziness. It was non radiating. The pain resolved when he sat in his car and rested for 5-10 minutes. Notes some history of passing "twinges" in the same area in the past, that lasted less than a second, and usually were associated with physical activity. He denies nausea, vomiting, abd pain, cough, headaches, blurred vision, and had no other associated symptoms at that time.  He is concerned today that he had a heart attack, since his father died in his 50s from cardiac causes.  ROS:  Pmhx: HTN Meds: Chlorthalidone 25mg daily, lisinopril 10mg daily No surgical history No allergies Tob: 1ppd x 20 years ETOH: 2-3  glasses of wine on the weekend No illicit substances Works in IT  O: Physical Exam VS: Afebrile General: alert and oriented CV: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs rubs or gallops Pulm: lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally  Assessment: Mr Cage is a 46 yo M with HTN and a long smoking history who presents with a single episode of chest pain 4 days ago that has since resolved. He notes a history of cardiac disease in his father who passed in his 50s. Suspect this is likely anginal in nature, but given the smoking and family history will pursue full cardiac work up.  Plan: EKG in office today to evaluate for any signs of T wave inversions or ST elevations, though have a low suspicion for MI given his complete resolution of symptoms, and the exertional nature of the pain he described. Order ECHO to evaluate for any hypertrophy, valvular dysfunction, or heart failure. Lower suspicion for this given normal physical exam Schedule stress test Will advise smoking cessation (did not do in the encounter today)
