Physical exam unremarkable. Patient likely has stable angina as his chest pain is substernal, worse w/ exertion, and relieved with rest. Unlikely to be panic disorder as he does not have a history of anxiety and is not worried about this happening in the future. Less likely to be HF as his JVD is not elevated, no SOB, and no LE edema.  Plan:  - EKG to assess ischemia - Serial troponins - BNP to assess HF - CBC, lipid panel, screen for DM2 w/ A1C - Given age and typical chest pain, patient is at high risk so stress test - Start patient on high intensity statin (atorvastatin 40mg), beta-blocker (metoprolol), and low dose ASA 81mg daily for mortality benefit after tests come back  - Increase dose of Lisinopril given his BP of 150 - Will discuss tobacco cessation and lifestyle modifications at follow up visit
