Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs/rubs/gallops.  Respiratory: clear to auscultation bilaterally MSK: no pain upon palpation of the chest   Assessment Ms. Gerry Cage is a 55-year old female present with acute chest pain for 5-10 minutes that occurred with strenuous activity. She notes multiple episodes of chest pain previously with exertion. Blood pressure today is 150/92 despite taking blood pressure medications today. Physical exam is significant for normal cardio and lung exam and no pain upon palpation of chest. Etiology is likely stable angina given chest pain only with exertion, HTN, smoking history, and family history of heart disease. Less likely musculoskeletal in nature (costochondritis) as pain is not exacerbated by movement and palpation on physical exam. Less likely myocardial infarction given absence of pain radiating down left arm but need EKG to confirm.      Plan - EKG - Repeat blood pressure in clinic. Give patient blood pressure cuff for home use and consider adjusting medications based on results. - Discuss diet and exercise.  - f/u in clinic per scheduled
