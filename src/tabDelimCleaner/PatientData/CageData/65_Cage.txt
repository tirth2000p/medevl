He endorses epigastric pain after eating lunch as well as recent episodes of minor chest pain with exertion that lasts 1-2 seconds.  Physical exam shows no significant findings.  The patient's presentation may be indicative of stable vs unstable angina due to chest pain with only minimal exertion that resolved after rest.  Other diagnoses could include stress as well as indigestion from a recent meal.  Further evaluation needed to ensure this was not an MI and to help prevent future possible MI if patient at risk.    Plan   - ECG   - Laboratory studies including CK and Troponin   - Consult with cardiology for further assessment since patient has not been evaluated by a cardiologist in past and has pertinent complaints as well as family history          - Consider stress test as well as echocardiography if needed   - Consider further evaluation for life stressors   - Consider eventual swallow study for signs of indigestion should cardiac evaluation not show any significant findings
