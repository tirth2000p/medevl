No nausea, vomiting, radiation of pain, inciting factors, numbness, tingling, diaphoresis. This has never occurred before. Pt is concerned she had a heart attack and is concerned it will happen again.

Normal physical exam. DD includes anxiety, chest wall strain, angina, and MI. Most likely angina due to hx of HTN and quality of sxs. Less likely chest wall strain due to non reproducibility of pain. Anxiety is a diagnosis of exclusion in this case but pt denied inciting factors for sxs so less likely.   Plan: - EKG in office today. Blood draw for BNP and troponin today, also lipid panel  - schedule a stress test  - follow- up with results - pt counseled on possibility of this being angina (lack of blood flow to the heart when it is under extrra strain or activity) and how depending on the test results, she may benefit from nitroglycerin when she experiences these sxs. she may need to start an aspirin and a statin if her lipid panel is concerning. We may need to counsel life tsyle mod or adjust bp med
