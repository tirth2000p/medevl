Pt is a 55 yo F who presents with a recent episode of Chest pain about 3 days ago as the patient was carrying heavy groceries to her car. Pt describes it as a "chest pressure" that is around the midsternum and lasts for about 15 min and is relieved with rest. She has had similar episodes in the past as she was exerting herself including running and climbing. She denies recent history of illness, fatigue, heart palpitations, a racing heartbeat, nausea, fevers, headaches, coughs, shortness of breath, changes to weight, or orthopnea. Pt's main concern is whether she had a heart attack given her strong family history of heart dz.  PMH: HTN Social History: was unable to obtain Surgical History: denies Family History: Father - CAD, bypass surgery, HTN, passed of heart attack at 40                            Mother - HTN, T2DM, passed of pulmonary embolism at 60  Objective: VS: BP - 150/92, HR 85, RR 14, T: 98.0F  PE:  Cardio:  RRR, Normal S1/S2, no murmurs, rubs, gallops. No JVD, no lower extremity edema. No bruits heard on carotids b/l Lungs: Clear breath sounds b/l, no extra effort.  Chest: No tenderness to palpation, no crepitus  Assessment/Plan  Patient is a 55 yo F who presents with off/on episodes of Chest pain about for the past year with the most recent episode 3 days ago of a sensation of pressure on the chest that is associated with exertion and improved with rest. Most likely on differential includes stable angina given onset of symptoms predominantly with exertion and history of HTN and strong family history of heart dz. Other differentials include Myocardial infarction, Arrythmia, and Pulmonary Embolism.  Plan: Obtain an EKG, Chest X-ray, CT Heart Calcium, and Echocardiogram. Given strong family history of heart disease, obtain baseline heart EF to rule out heart failure and structural causes of chest pain. Start a Baby Aspirin, consult f/up with Cardiology
