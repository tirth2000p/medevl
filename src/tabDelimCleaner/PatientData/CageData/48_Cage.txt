Most likely diagnosis is angina: substernal pressure came on with exertion, relieved with rest. Less likely PE as pain was not pleuritic and relieved spontaneously. Costochondritis unlikely as well given lack of reproducible pain, no systemic signs of inflammation - labs: CBC, BMP, lipid panel, troponins - EKG in clinic - refer to exercise stress testing - Start ASA 81mg daily - Consider increase in dose of lisinopril; cannot rule out white coat hypertension/stress for high BP today
