Subjective: Patient is 46yo M/ w/ PMH who presents to clinic with recent chest pain. The patient states he was carrying groceries to his car when he felt a sudden, deep ache that was heavy and he had to put his groceries down and sit in his car and rest for 5-10 min which rsolved the symptoms. He felt lightheaded and like "the wind was knocked out of him" but no SOB. He reports having similar symptoms w/ exertion over the last 4 months that only lasted a few seconds. He states that his father had an early MI at 40 that required bypass surgery.   Objective: Vitals: Temp - 98 P - 85 R - 14 BP - 150/92  Meds: Clorthalidone, Lisinopril  PMH: HTN  Fam History: Father - MI in mid 40s s/p bypass surgery  PE: Heart: RRR, clear s1/s2 w/ no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB  Assessment: Patient is a 46yo M w/ PMH of HTN who presents to clinic with recent chest pain. The pain occurs during exertion and the most recent was described as a sudden, deep ache that feels heavy with associated lightheadedness and resolved after 5-10 minutes of rest. The pain was non-positional without associated SOB. He began having symptoms about 4 months ago while exerting himself but they only lasted a few seconds. His father had an MI in his mid-40s and required bypass surgery. This patient's pain is likely stable angina 2/2 a hereditary condition due to his chest pain only during exertion that resolves with rest and his father having an MI at a young age. The patient also endorsed a feeling of fullness/pressure in the midsternal region following a large meal on occasion so patient's symptoms could possibly be related to GERD, but unlikely as patient's previous meal prior to the last episode was about 4 hours prior.   Plan: - EKG - Stress test - CBC / CMP - Lipid panel - Discuss with patient possibility of including his father in discussion to see if genetic component is at play - If all of this is negative consider upper endoscopy to assess for GERD or other etiologies of chest pain
