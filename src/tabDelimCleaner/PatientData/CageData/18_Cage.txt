CC: chest pain  Subjective: Mr. Gerry Cage is a 47 year old male with past medical history significant for HTN who presents to the clinic with report of chest pain 3 days ago. Patient reports that he was carrying "heavy groceries" 3 days ago when he started to experience sudden, intense mid-sternal chest pain and light headedness, which lasted 5 minutes and resolved after sitting down. He states that the pain was "deep ache and heavy" in quality, and states that it "knocked the wind out of me" but denies shortness of breath. Denies palpitations, dizziness or syncope. Reports that he has had 2-3 episodes of twinge pain in the mid-sternal area when running or taking stairs over the last 4 months, and had 2-3 episodes of "pressure" pain in that area after eating in the last year.  PMH: HTN Medications: Lisinopril 10 mg QD, Clopalidone 25 mg QD  Family history: Father: MI in 40's s/p bypass Mother: HTN  Social: 1 pack/day cigarette usage, 2-3 glasses of wine on weekends, denies illicit drug use.  Objective: VS: 98 degrees, 85 bpm, 14 rpm, 150/92 mmHg Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm. PMI non-displaced. 2+ and equal radial and PT pulses bilaterally. Pulmonary: CTAB in anterior and posterior fields.  Assessment: Mr. Cage is a 47 year old male with history of HTN who presents with one episode of sever chest pain 3 days ago. With patient's history of mid-sternal chest pain, HTN and family history of MI in father, most likely diagnosis is angina, and workup is needed to rule out MI or abnormality of the heart. Differential diagnosis also includes MSK chest pain, GERD and panic attack.  Additionally, based on history, patient may also have undiagnosed GERD, but recent severe episode makes that diagnosis unlikely to be the cause of that event.  Plan: EKG Schedule echocardiogram CBC Consider increasing dosage of blood pressure medications if testing is normal. Follow up in 2 weeks
