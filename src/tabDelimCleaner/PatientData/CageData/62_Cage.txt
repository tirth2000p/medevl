Subjective: Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female with history of HTN and smoking who presented to clinic today after any episode of chest pain 3 days ago. She was carrying lots of groceries from her car when she felt a deep ache in her sternum that went away after sitting in her car for 5-10 minutes. There was no radiation of the pain and she ranked the pain at a 7/10. She has never had this exact episode before but she has had episodes of twinges previously. Nothing made it worse. She does take Chlorthalidone 25 mg and Lisinopril 10 mg every day. Family history is significant for her dad who had a heart attack in his 40s and who needed a CABG for CAD. She has been smoking 1 ppd for 30 years. She lives in the West End and works for Capital One. She is worried that she has had a heart attack.  Objective: Vital Signs: BP 150/92 HR 85 RR 14 T 98.0 PE: CV: S1 and S2 audible in all 4 fields. PMI is appropriately located in the 5th intercostal space midaxillary line. No pain on palpation of sternum. Radial pulses 2+ bilaterally. Carotids 2+ bilaterally, no bruits.  Assessment: Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female with history of HTN and smoking who presented for chest pain that happened 3 days ago. Most likely due to stable angina with history of smoking and HTN and no other episodes. Less likely unstable angina (no symptoms today) and costochondritis (no pain on palpation).  Plan: - I discussed with the patient the physical exam findings. Today's BP was elevated though patient is taking medications as prescribed. We will increase Lisinopril to 20 mg. Will check BMP in 2 weeks - We will get an exercise stress test to look for CAD especially with history of smoking 1 ppd x 30 years as well as HTN. We discussed that results could potentially show us if there has been a prior infarct - We will see pt 1 week after test.
