Ms Gerry Cage is a 55yoF who presents with a 3 day h/o isolated 6/10 chest pain in the midsternal region that occurred after she lifted heavy bottles from the grocery store to her car. It lasted about 10 minutes and subsided on its own after she rested. She describes the pain as aching/heavy and not sharp. The pain did not radiate. She felt faint at the time but otherwise had no other symptoms. Over the last 4 months, she also reports similar pain but much less intense (described as "flutters" of pain). She is concerned whether she had an MI.  PHX: HTN - controlled with chlorthalidone/lisinopril SHX: tobacco 1PPD, ETOH weekends: 2-3 drinks, no drugs FHX: father: CAD, died from MI at 40, mother DM2/HTN, died from PE 60  Vitals: BP150/92, p85, RR14, T98F PE:  General: NAD, calm, cooperative Lung: CTAB, no inc WOB Heart: S1/s2 no m/r/g, regular rate/rhythm, no peripheral edema, distal pulses 2+  Ms. Cage is a 55yoF presenting with an isolated episode of substernal chest pain brought on by increased activity 3 days ago. Symptoms have since resolved completely. PE is largely unremarkable. Episode likely represented a manifestation of stable angina given relation to activity, family history of CAD/MI, tobacco use, and HTN. DDx would include GERD (less likely as it was an isolated episode not coinciding with meals), costochondritis (less likely given lack of tenderness to palpation).  Plan: Establish diagnosis of stable angina/CAD -12 lead EKG -troponin, BMP, CBC, lipid panel, A1c -schedule echocardiograph, stress test, coronary angiography -subsequent Tx to include secondary prevention (statin; LDL<70), ASA, nitrates for breakthrough anginal pain, tight BP control, cessation of smoking
