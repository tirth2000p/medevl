Subjective: Ms. Cage says she began having severe chest pain and tightness 3 days ago. It was after walking and carrying heavy jugs of liquid. It lasted 5-10 minutes and was 7/10 in severity. The pain did not radiate down her left arm and was not accompanied by upper or lower back pain, dizziness, or neck pain. She feels completely fine now.  Patient says her BP readings at work, which is almost daily, are usually normal. She is unsure why her BP is elevated today.  Objective vitals: BP 150/92 HR:85 RR:14 Temp 98F  PE: General: No acute distress.  Heart: RRR at all 4 locations Lungs: CTA Extremities: No edema  Assessment: Ms. Cage, with FHx significant for HTN, DM, and heart attack in her father at a young age of 40 years old, has signs in her history 3 days ago consistent with a heart attack.  Further workup is required to determine next steps in management. She is at a high risk for heart attack given her HTN, FHx, and recent symtoms of chest pain.  Less likely diagnoses: Stable angina: Heart attack like symptoms make this a less likely diagnosis. However, pain only with exertion (not at rest) is consistent with this. GERD: Less likely, although on differential because of her heavy meals giving her heaviness in her chest. You would expect to see burning also, however.    Plan 1. EKG, Troponins 2. If Troponins are positive or EKG is consistent with a STEMI, cardiology consult needed 3. Aspirin 81mg QD 4. Echo if #1 is positive
