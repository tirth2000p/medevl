Subjective: Gerry Cage is a 46yo male with a history of HTN who presents with chest pain on exertion. He reports that yesterday, as he was carrying heavy groceries to his car, he experienced deep chest pain, 7/10, "kind of heavy," that subsided after a few minutes of rest in his car. He reports that this has happened at least twice before ove rthe past four months, once while going up stairs, and once while running to catch a friend, although these episodes were not as severe pain-wise. Denies pain at rest. Denies history of acid reflux although endorses nonburning postprandial pain in epigastric area. Denies history of stomach ulcers, recent chest trauma. Denies pain in arms or legs with exertion. Takes chlorthalidone and lisinopril for HTN otherwise no other meds. Father had an MI 40s and underwent bypass, mom has HTN as well. 20PY smoking history, continues to smoke, amenable to trying to quit. 2-3glasses of wine/week. Works in IT at Capital One. Denies regular exercise regimen.  NKMA, meds as above, immunizations UTD.  Objective: T 98f, BP 150/92, HR 85, RR 14 PE CV: RRR, no m/r/g. Pulm: CTAB, NLB. Abd: Soft, nontender, nondistended. Negative murphy's sign. MSK: Ribs, sternum nontender to palpation throughout.  Assessment: 46yo male w/ HTN who presents w/ multiple episodes of chest pain on exertion. Family history significant for early MI, social history significant for current tobacco use, and exam otherwise unremarkable, suggestive of stable angina. DDx includes costochondritis and acid reflux, although these are unlikely based on H&P findings (lack of tenderness to palpation of chest, association of pain w/ eating).  Plan: - Refer to cardiology for workup of angina: stress test, possible imaging - Discussed lifestyle changes such as exercise and tobacco cessation, patient amenable, so will provide resources
