He states that it came on suddenly and he felt like the wind was knocked out of him. He does report that he has noticed twinges of chest pain that last for a few seconds about 2-3 times per month over the past 4 months. The prior episodes occurred with walking up stairs or running. Also endorses some indigestion symptoms after eating a large meal, but does not feel those are related.   Allergies: None Meds: Chlorthiadone, Lisinopril PMHx: HTN - Bps run in the 130s/80s at home.

A: Middle-aged man with hx of HTN who presents with intermittent chest pain on exertion over the past few months. Symptoms seem consistent with angina. Angina is likely given the nature of symptoms occurring on exertion and being relieved by rest. Also given patient's hx of HTN and smoking as well as patient's significant family history for cardiac events. Less likely GERD.   Plan: - EKG - Stress test - BMP / CBC / Lipid panel / Troponin  - Start on a beta blocker - re-evaluate BP regimen  - Start on aspirin and a statin if cholesterol is elevated  - Recommend smoking cessation
