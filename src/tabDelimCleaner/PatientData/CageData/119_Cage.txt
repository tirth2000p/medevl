With family history, need to rule out structural heart disease.  o Order EEG. Draw lipid panel, troponins, CBC w/diff, BMP o A1C due to risk factors. Patient may need statin therapy if lipid profile supports.  o Echo if concerns on EEG  o HTN counseling: not well controlled on current regimen. Diet counseling and exercise counseling. Recommend increasing Lisinopril and RTC in 4 weeks, get BP cuff at home and take pressures daily if possible  Kristen Lospinoso, M3
