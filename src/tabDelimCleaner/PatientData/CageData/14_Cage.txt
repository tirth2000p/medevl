S- HPI: Gerry Cage is a X year old male with a history of HTN who presents for 4 months of exertional chest pain which is relieved with rest. States in the last 4 months he has had 2-3 episodes of this exertional chest pain which last for a few seconds. A few days ago he was at the grocery store carrying heavy bags to his car when he sudden developed more severe chest pain than in the past. He reported feeling dizzy and felt like " the wind was knocked out of him". Patient states his BP at home are usually 130/80. Denies SOB, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, or leg swelling. Of note, he also reports chest pressure after eating 2-3 times per week that resolves on its own but thinks the pain he is currently complaining of is not related.  Meds: 25 mg Chlorthalidone daily, 10 mg Lisinopril daily  FHx: Father with CAD and MI at age 40 s/p CABG Mother with HTN and DM  SHx: smokes 1 pack/week x20 years, 2-3 glasses of wine Saturday and Sunday, denies illicit drug use  O- 150/92, 85, 14, 98 Gen: appears anxious but in NAD, sitting on exam table Cardio: RRR Pulm: CTAB Ext: no LE edema  A-40 something year old male with 20 year smoking history,  h/o HTN, and FHx of heart disease presents after an episode of exertional chest pain associated with lightheadedness relieved with rest.  DDx: Stable angina: most likely given patient's h/o HTN, FHx, and smoking history, the fact that he has never had chest pain while at rest makes stable angina more likely Unstable angina: less likely given pain is only exertional Musculoskeletal: forgot to palpate chest but reproducible pain would make this more likely Myocardial infarction: less likely given the patient is not currently having any symptoms and vital signs are within normal limits (except for elevated BP which is more likely due to anxiety around having had a heart attack)   P-EKG to assess for STEMI and evidence of previous MI, also need EKG for comparison if there was no prior Schedule a stress test given the patient's concerning personal and family history If the patient develops chest pain or shortness of breath I would have a low threshold for getting a troponin Rx nitro for pain relief if exertional chest pain continues
