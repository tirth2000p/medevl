Subjective HPI: Gerry Cage is a middle aged female with PmHx of HTN presenting with recurrent chest pain on exertion. Last week, while carrying two 5 galloon jugs of water to the car at ellwood thompson, she felt a severe pressure on her chest which took her breathe away.  This pain went away with rest. She experienced this twice before in the past four months while exerting herself similarly but at that time it was only a twinge of pain. She denies ever experiencing leg pain while walking.  She is followed by her PCP and is said to have lipids under control. She states her blood pressure is well controlled at home.   PMHx Meds: lisinopril and chlorthalidone  Allergies: none FamHx: Dad MI at age 40 and CABG, Mom- 60 PE Htn, DM2 bothe deceased, 2 healthy brothers SocialHx:   Objective: VS:  Temp: 98   BP:  150/92   Pulse: 85      RR: 14  General: no acute distress HENT: normocephalic CV: RRR, no murmurs, peripheral pulses intact bilaterally, no LE Lung: CTAB  Abd: soft, non-tender Msk: chest non tender to palpation  Neuro: no focal neurological deficits Psych: alerted and oriented    Assessment: Gerry Cage is a middle age female with stable angina likely due to myocardial ischemia. Her family history, chest pain upon exertion and relief with rest make this the most likely cause. Much less likely causes of chest pain for her could be aortic stenosis, panic attacks, or GERD.     Plan: Stable angina:  -ECG -Exercise stress test, consider to TTE for valvular evaluation if stress test fails to identify ischemia -Lipid profile
