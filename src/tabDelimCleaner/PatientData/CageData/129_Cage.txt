Capillary refill > 3 s. Lungs CTAB bilaterally.   Objective Mr. Cage is a 46 year old M with a PMH of HTN presenting with 3 episodes of chest pain on exertion. Most likely differential is angina, since the pain is with exertion and went away rapidly with rest. It is also probable to be angina as he has a history of HTN, smokes and has a significant history of heart disease. It is less likely that he had an MI since the episode was so short. Less likely HF since he has no SOB. Costochondritis is less likely since there is no pain reproducible on palpation. The episodes of pain did not happen while eating so GERD is less likely.   Plan - EKG  - F/u with results  - Contact PCP regarding HTN control - If angina consider starting Nitroglycerin and referral to cardiology
