CC: "recent chest pain"  HPI: Mr. Gerry Cage is a 46 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension who presents for recent chest pain/pressure upon exertion a few days ago. He currently denies any chest pain. A few days ago, he was carrying groceries to his car when he suddenly felt 7/10, non-radiating, deep heaviness in the central chest. He dropped his groceries and sat in his car for a few minutes which relieved his symptoms. He notes that in the past four months he has had two to three similar but more minor episodes of his recent symptoms. he denies shortness of breath, cough, bilateral leg swelling, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, back pain, shoulder pain, bilateral arm weakness or any other associated symptoms.  Meds: Chlorthalidone and Lisinopril (HTN)  Allergies: none reported.  PMH: Hypertension  Social: smoker- 1 ppd/20 years, denies alcohol use, no recreational drug use.   Surgical: none reported.  Family: Father- MI, CAD (CABG), Mother- HTN, Type 2 DM, PE; Maternal grandmother- breast cancer; 2 brothers- healthy  Objective: BP 150/92 Pulse 85 RR 14 Temp 98 F  PE: Cardio- normal rate, regular rhythm. no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. no peripheral edema bilaterally. Pulm- clear to auscultation in both anterior and posterior lung fields. no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.  Assessment: 46 year old male with a past medical history of hypertension who presents for recent onset chest pain upon exertion and relieved with rest along with associated high blood pressure in clinic. Likely diagnosis is ACS syndrome - stable angina vs. unstable angina vs. NSTEMI. Other ddx- MI, PE, asthma.  Plan:  Hypertension -increase chlorthalidone/lisinopril OR add another medication -counsel on behavioral changes - diet changes with FAST diet (decreases blood pressure by 11 mm Hg)  Chest pain/pressure -smoking cessation counseling -referral for cardiology for exercise stress testing - will help determine stable vs. unstable. vs NSTEMI -potentially EKG - given no current symptoms and most recent episodes few days ago and no signs of acute MI would suggest against this at this time
