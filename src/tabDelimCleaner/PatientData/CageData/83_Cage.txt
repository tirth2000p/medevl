S: Gerry Cage is a 55 yo F with HTN presenting to clinic three days after an episode of chest pain. The chest pain occurred while she was walking groceries to her car. She experienced the pain in the  middle of her chest. Describes the pain as a deep, aching pain. Pain lasted for about 5-10 minutes and resolved after she sat in her car. Endorses feeling faint and a sensation of "having her breath taken away." Denies diaphoresis or limb numbness/tingling. Endorses past history of similar "chest twinges" that also occur with exertion. Denies chest pain at rest. Of note, patient smokes cigarettes 1 PPD x 30 years. Works a sedentary job and walks dog for exercise. 4-5 coffees per day. Strong family history of cardiovascular disease with father MI @ 40 and mother PE @ 60.   O:  VS: BP 150/92 HR: 85 RR: 14 T: 98F Gen appearance: No acute distress Cardio: Regular rate, normal rhythm.

Strong family history of cardiovascular disease. Given HTN, tobacco use, and family hx, patient is at risk for coronary artery disease and I am concerned this was an episode of anginal chest pain.  DDx: Stable angina - pain is substernal occurring with exertion NSTEMI/STEMI GERD  Costochondritis - less likely given no chest wall tenderness  P: EKG with troponin BMP/CBC  Lipid panel - if elevated LDL add moderate intensity statin  Consider adding beta blocker or calcium channel blocker
