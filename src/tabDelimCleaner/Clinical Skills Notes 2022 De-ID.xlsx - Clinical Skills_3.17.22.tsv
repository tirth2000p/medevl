2022/03/15 2:07:57 PM AST	5	Williams	Subjective HPI: Baby boy Williams is a previously healthy 5 day old M. His mother is concerned today due to increasing jaundice and now scleral icterus. She states that there was no concern for hyperbilirubinemia while in the hospital but since discharge, his skin has become more yellow over the past 3-4 days. She noticed some yellowing of the eyes yesterday which concerned her. This is Mom's first baby. She notes no increased fussiness. He has been feeding well, every 3 hours for 10-15 minutes per breast. Mom notes good milk let down but states family member is concern about his weight. Baby James is making 6-8 wet diapers per day and is stooling several times daily. Mom describes stool as yellow/green and not pale or greasy. She is exclusively breastfeeding and has not supplemented with formula.  PMHx/PShx: None - unclear bilirubin levels in hospital but never needed UV lights Mom and baby have same blood time - lower concern for hemolysis  Social hx:  Live at home with parents  Family hx: Mom has history of jaundice as a newborn. No known family hx of jaundice disorders like gilbert, rotor, dubin-johnson etc.   Meds: None  Allergies: None  Objective Vitals: None - encounter done virtually Exam: None- encounter done virtually. Mom describes baby as jaundiced with scleral icterus present.  Assessment Baby James is a previously healthy 5 day old baby with uncomplicated birth history seen virtually in clinic today for concern regarding jaundice worsening for 3-4 days and scleral icterus for the past day. Unclear bilirubin at this time, but mom states no concern at pediatrician yesterday. Most likely benign hyperbilirubinemia in infancy, less likely to be genetic syndrome like gilbert given negative family hx. Low concern for biliary atresia. Unlikely breastfeeding jaundice (poor nutrition) given history - appears to be feeding well.  Plan -See in clinic today to evaluate for hyperbilirubinemia - check serum bilirubin and trend, particularly if elevated. Can take to ED if unable to schedule an appointment. Conjugated vs unconjugated bilirubin. -Newborn screen pending - follow for possible hemolytic disorder/RBC disorder (Hereditary spherocytosis, etc) -Can consider ultrasound of RUQ if elevated conjugated bilirubin -If elevated unconjugated bilirubin, likely benign hyperbilirubinemia of infancy and will want to admit for UV lights -Check weight, if significant decrease in weight, could be breastfeeding jaundice and would want to supplement with pumped breast milk or even formula if Mom is amenable.

Assessment: Jane Smith is a previously healthy 26 yo F who presents with 1 day of lower back pain, onset while lifting heavy tree. Pain radiates down L thigh. No associated numbness, tingling, or weakness. Most likely a paraspinal muscle strain given findings on exam and nature of injury. Less likely to be a herniated disk or vertebral fracture given age and no hx of osteopenia. No concern for cauda equina syndrome given exam and hx.  Plan -Recommend conservative management at this time and continue to monitor for improvement. Can use heat pads and try epsom salt bath, possibly a back brace if she finds it helpful -For pain, can't take oxycodone or NSAIDs due to allergies. Can try acetaminophen. unlikely gabapentin would be helpful given nature of symptoms. Ultimately needs to rest to recover. Can revisit pharmacologic pain control if symptoms do not improve. -Return to clinic if symptoms worsen or any alarm symptoms (new onset weakness, worsening pain, fevers, swelling in lower back) -No need for imaging at this time given low yield and likely muscular strain. Can consider in future but unlikely to change management at this time. -Talk with work to switch to less physically demanding job. Can provide work note if needed

Exam is notable for tenderness to palpation in all 4 abdominal quadrants with no guarding or rebound tenderness. Vitals showed patient is febrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic.   1. Peritonitis: Given severity of pain, hypotension, and tachycardia, concern for perforated viscus in abdomen or other cause of peritoneal irritation. Possible etiologies include ruptured ulcer while cholecystitis and appendicitis are less likely given diffuse location of pain. Will order upright XR and state CT. f XR is consitent with perforated viscus, will send for emergency surgery. In the meantime will give patient opioid analgesics for pain, and put in 2 large bore IV lines for fluids, start her on 1 L normal saline bolus for hypotension. Will also order CBC and CMP for additional evaluation and to discover possible electrolyte abnormalities given vomiting, instability.   2. Aortic dissection: possible given history of hypertension, acute onset, and hemodynamic instability, but less likely given abdominal rather than thoracic location. Will follow up with CT if other work up is negative.   3. Pancreatitis: Epigastric pain consistent with symptoms, but progression to diffuse pain makes this less likely. Will order amylase and lipase to rule out, as well as CT if upright XR is unremarkable.   4. Gastroenteritis: Given history of eating leftover pork chop, toxin mediated gastroenteritis could be cause. Will rule out more serious etiologies while giving patient supportive care in interim.

Sitting, standing, and walking make the pain worse and she reports "8/10" pain at worst. Pain is most significant on the sides rather than in the middle.

No bowel or bladder incontinence. Physical exam significant for L>R paraspinal tenderness with some midline tenderness in the thoracic region. Negative SLR bilaterally. Most likely muscle strain given the setting of injury.  DDx: Muscle strain- most likely given the setting of the injury and physical exam with lateral tenderness worse than midline tenderness Compression fracture: likely given some midline tenderness on exam but less likely due to age with no history of malignancy or vitamin D deficiency Sciatica: less likely given negative straight leg raise bilaterally   P-Rx muscle relaxer to see if there is improvement in pain, recommended NSAIDs in addition and follow up 2 days if no improvement (since the patient has to work in 2 days) Consider XR of T-spine since the patient did have some midline tenderness concerning for compression fracture, if concerning study have to patient return to the office for further testing 
2022/03/28 11:01:17 AM AST	14	Cage	S- HPI: Gerry Cage is a X year old male with a history of HTN who presents for 4 months of exertional chest pain which is relieved with rest.

DDx: Stable angina: most likely given patient's h/o HTN, FHx, and smoking history, the fact that he has never had chest pain while at rest makes stable angina more likely Unstable angina: less likely given pain is only exertional Musculoskeletal: forgot to palpate chest but reproducible pain would make this more likely Myocardial infarction: less likely given the patient is not currently having any symptoms and vital signs are within normal limits (except for elevated BP which is more likely due to anxiety around having had a heart attack)   P-EKG to assess for STEMI and evidence of previous MI, also need EKG for comparison if there was no prior Schedule a stress test given the patient's concerning personal and family history If the patient develops chest pain or shortness of breath I would have a low threshold for getting a troponin Rx nitro for pain relief if exertional chest pain continues

Most concern for major depressive disorder given the patient reports at least 5 of the SIG E CAPS symptoms of MDD.   DDx:  Major Depressive Disorder: most likely given 5+ SIG E CAPS criteria and duration of symptoms greater than 2 weeks Hypothyroidism: less likely given the patient does not have a family or personal history of thyroid disease, denies weight gain or cold intolerance Anemia: less likely given the patient does not report sources of bleeding (GU or GI) and denies chest pain/SOB/pale or feeling cold  P- Prescribe SSRI and follow up in 2 weeks to assess improvement, follow up sooner or go to an emergency room if you develop thoughts of suicidality or ending your life in which you feel you may act on Suggested counseling/therapy services  Although the patient does not report a history of hypothyroidism I would get a TSH just to check thyroid function. Do not want to chase something psych related when it can be ruled out easily

PHX: HTN - controlled with chlorthalidone/lisinopril SHX: tobacco 1PPD, ETOH weekends: 2-3 drinks, no drugs FHX: father: CAD, died from MI at 40, mother DM2/HTN, died from PE 60  Vitals: BP150/92, p85, RR14, T98F PE:  General: NAD, calm, cooperative Lung: CTAB, no inc WOB Heart: S1/s2 no m/r/g, regular rate/rhythm, no peripheral edema, distal pulses 2+  Ms. Cage is a 55yoF presenting with an isolated episode of substernal chest pain brought on by increased activity 3 days ago. Symptoms have since resolved completely. PE is largely unremarkable. Episode likely represented a manifestation of stable angina given relation to activity, family history of CAD/MI, tobacco use, and HTN. DDx would include GERD (less likely as it was an isolated episode not coinciding with meals), costochondritis (less likely given lack of tenderness to palpation).  Plan: Establish diagnosis of stable angina/CAD -12 lead EKG -troponin, BMP, CBC, lipid panel, A1c -schedule echocardiograph, stress test, coronary angiography -subsequent Tx to include secondary prevention (statin; LDL<70), ASA, nitrates for breakthrough anginal pain, tight BP control, cessation of smoking

No wheezing or abnormal lung sounds.  Abdomen: No pain or tenderness to palpation. No obvious abnormalities.    A/P Mr. Cage is a middle aged M with a PMHx of HTN who presents to clinic after an episode of chest pain while exerting himself and associated lightheadedness. He reports similar episodes in the past which where much less severe. On physical examination he is noted to be hypertensive, with normal heart rate and rhythm. Symptoms likely due to unstable angina due to the worsening of chest pain symptoms over the past 4 months with exertion, this would also be supported by patients family and smoking history. Symptoms could also be due to NSTEMI given chest pain, family, social, and past medical history of HTN. less likely costochondritis due to absence of chest wall tenderness though possible due to onset of chest pain with exertion. Less likely GERD due to onset of most recent episode with exertion as opposed to relation to meal.   Plan:  1) Send to ED  2) Obtain labs: troponins, CBC, CMP  3) Obtain EKG  4) Depending on labs/EKG could consider obtaining stress test vs cardiac catheterization.

Suspecting pancreatitis as most likely due to quality/character of pain with radiation to the back and sudden onset with associated vomiting. Other possibly diagnosis include appendicitis given sudden onset of pain and patient being febrile. Also on the differential is acute gastritis given onset after a meal, worse in the epigastric region, and associated tobacco/alcohol use.  1) NPO  2) Obtain labs: CMP, CBC, Amylase, Lipase 3) Depending on lab results may consider ordering a CT abdomen/pelvis  3) CXR, EKG Troponins to rule out atypical myocardial infarction given significant family  history  4) Pain management: Scheduled Tylenol 5) Zofran PRN Nausea  
2022/03/29 11:59:33 AM AST	38	Williams	Name: Baby Boy James Williams Age: 5 days old C:C: "my baby's eyes are yellow" HPI: History obtained from patient's mother over Zoom. Per patient's mother, James's skin was yellow when she was leaving the hospital the other day. She mentioned it at her first pediatrics appointment on DOL 2, but the pediatrician stated that it was normal. His skin continued to be yellow, and she noticed today, on DOL 5, that his eyes were yellow, prompting the call. She denies any increase in fussiness, denies any subjective noticing of fevers. She does report that she notices he appears congested. She states that he passed meconium following birth and has had yellow-green colored stools since then. She reports he makes 6-8 wet diapers a day.  Pregnancy was complicated by GBS positive status treated with antibiotics. Birth was a vaginal birth, no complications. Patient's mother states that she is breastfeeding and feels that it is going well as James is eating regularly, but did ask about formula supplementation.  Physical Exam:  VS: N/A  Exam deferred due to virtual nature of the visit  Assessment: Baby Boy James Williams is a 5-day-old male presenting over Zoom for a history of jaundice since birth and new-onset yellowing of the eyes. These skin and scleral changes are likely due to physiological jaundice due to a lack of adequate conjugation of bilirubin. Other items on the differential include Criggler-Najar, breast-feeding jaundice, and breast-milk jaundice.  Plan: Patient's mother was instructed to bring baby boy James in to the office for a physical exam, transcutaneous and serum bilirubin check, and weight check. Depending on bilirubin level in labs, may consider UV light phototherapy and potentially plasma exchange transfusion. May also may recommendations for changes to feeding depending on weight and how his weight is trending since birth. These instructions and guidance for potential treatment plans were conveyed to patient's mother. May consider home nurse visit depending on results of the visit.

2022/03/07 1:01:25 PM AST	48	Williams	HPI 5 day old boy with uncomplicated birth at 39w presenting with complaints that eyes are yellow. Born at MCV, mother GBS + and received intrapartum PCN. Skin and eyes were yellow at birth, doctors did not feel the need to treat. Jaundice is worsening. Pt has not vomited. Had checkup 2 days ago with pediatrician, had lost a small amount of weight at that time. Breastfeeding exclusively with good production. Yellow-green stools, soft. 6-8 wet diapers/day. Pt sleeps 3 hours at a time, feeds every 3 hours. Sleeps in bassinet.  Family history Mom was a "yellow baby" as a child, denies episodes of jaundice as an adult  Physical exam Unable to assess, mom would not allow me to see the child  Assessment/Plan Would expect jaundice to peak at 2-4 days and have started resolving by this point. Given inability to assess patient, apparent worsening jaundice, and severe risks of not treating, would like pt to present to pediatrician. Most likely benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. other possible etiologies Gilbert syndrome, breastfeeding jaundice less likely given good milk production, cholestasis. Breast milk jaundice would onset after 1-2 weeks. Hemolytic disease possible but unlikely to be undiagnosed after delivery at MCV. - Do not supplement with formula at this time - Present to pediatrician  for bilirubin levels to be drawn
2022/04/07 2:31:00 PM AST	49	Williams	HPI James is a 5 day old boy who presents via zoom call for yellowing of eyes noticed by mom.

2022/04/07 2:02:20 PM AST	50	Williams	Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old who presents with yellowing of the eyes and skin. This was first noticed this morning. He was seen 2 days ago and had his bilirubin checked and was told it was normal. He also has some congestion. He has been exclusively breast feeding every 3 hours. At his appointment two days ago he had lost 2oz from his birthweight. His stools were initially black and tarry and are now greenish yellow. He is urinating appropriately. He is sleeping for about two hours between his meals every three hours. He is not more fussy than normal and there has not been any abdominal distention noted.  Objective: Deferred due to zoom. (I should have asked to see the child)  Assessment: Baby boy James is a 5 day old presenting with jaundice first noticed on the 5th day of life in the eyes and skin. He is breast feeding, stooling, urinating, and growing appropriately. The differential includes benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, breast milk jaundice, severe hyperbilirubinemia, or a genetic bilirubin clearance disorder  Plan: I have recommended that Ms. Williams bring baby boy James into the office for a bilirubin check. Although most likely benign, zoom limits the ability to examine James and there is no way to measure bilirubin to determine if it is pathologically elevated. The risks of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia outweigh the risks of coming to the office for the bilirubin check. 
2022/04/07 1:35:23 PM AST	50	Abbott	Subjective: Ms. Nancy Abbot is a young woman presenting today with "a heavy period that wont stop". Symptoms began 2 weeks ago and have been persistent. She is going through 4 pads and 4 tampons per day and is still "having accidents". She is passing quarter sized clots. She has associated cramps, back spasms, feeling bloated, dizziness, lightheadedness, and increased thirst. She denies fever chills changes in bowel habits and blood in the urine or stool. Her menses are typically irregular and unpredictable, sometimes heavy and sometimes light, however this is more bleeding than she's ever had before. She has one partner and they use condoms for contraception and sometimes forget to wear them. She takes no medications, has no relevant past medical history, and no surgeries. She has had no children   Objective: Gen: laying uncomfortably on the bed holding her abdomen Abdominal exam: Bowel sounds normal. Mildly tender to palpation over the lower quadrants bilaterally. No rebound no guarding.  GU: Anteverted uterus, approximately 10 weeks in size and irregular. No adnexal masses. No cervical motion tenderness. Rectal: No blood in the rectum.   Assessment: Ms. Abbot is a young woman presenting today with 2 weeks of persistent heavy vaginal bleeding with clots. Her menses are irregular, however this is worse. She has associated dizziness, lightheadedness, and thirst. Her exam is significant for an enlarged irregular uterus of 10 weeks size, no adnexal masses, and no cervical motion tenderness. The differential diagnosis for her is an incomplete abortion, fibroids, adenomyosis, pregnancy, endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, ectopic pregnancy. Less likely to be ovarian torsion, bleeding disorder, ruptured ovarian cyst.   Plan: Due to ongoing bleeding, I recommend that she go to the emergency room as she is showing signs of anemia and significant blood loss. She will need a CBC and BMP there as well as a urine pregnancy test. A transvaginal ultrasound vs a CT may be helpful in the future pending the pregnancy test to evaluate for fibroids.

2022/04/07 2:31:23 PM AST	50	Smith	Subjective: Ms. Jane Smith presents to the office with low back pain. She was helping with yard work yesterday when she felt a twinge in her low back. Her pain is globally over the low back and extends down the back of the left leg and stops at level of the knee. She has no numbness, weakness, or tingling. Rest and heat improve pain, while sitting, standing, and any movement worsen pain. She has taken valium and percocet for pain. She denies any neck pain and any history of low back pain.   Objective: Vitals 120/78 Hr 72 RR 16 98%o2 saturation  General: uncomfortable appearing, sitting upright on the exam table Back: Tender to palpation over the paraspinal muscles in the low back. Straight leg raise negative. sensation intact through the lower extremities bilaterally. Strength intact in the lower extremities bilaterally. Low back rotation range of motion is full and painless.  Assessment: Ms. Smith present with acute onset low back and left leg pain after yard work with no numbness, tingling, or weakness. Exam notable for tenderness over the left lower paraspinal muscles, negative straight leg raise, and full strength and sensation. She has likely strained her back muscles. She has no neurologic signs indicating a herniated disc, sciatica, or lumbar radiculopathy although those may still be possible.   Plan: Tylenol and NSAIDs should be first line for pain. I have counseled her against using percocet and valium, particularly together due to the risk of respiratory depression. She should improve with time and rest. I have prescribed physical therapy to begin once she is out of the acute painful phase in a week or two, which should help pain and to prevent further injuries. She may return to the office with new or worsening symptoms or if her pain does not improve with time. An x-ray can be considered if he symptoms do not improve. 
2022/04/07 2:59:08 PM AST	50	Cage	Ms. Gerry Cage presents today for chest pain. 3 days ago she was carrying groceries and water when she felt a deep, heavy substernal chest pain. She had associated shortness of breath and feeling faint. She rested in her car for 5-10 minutes and it improved. She has had some "twinges" of chest pain the past few months with activity. She has hypertension which is well controlled with clorthalidone and lisinopril. She follows up with regular labs and doesnt believe she has high cholesterol. She has a family history of her father passing from a heart attack at age 40. She is anxious about having a heart attack. Denies nausea, vomiting. no chest pain in the office today.  Objective: BP 150/92 HR 85 98F RR 14 General: Anxious appearing, fidgeting and wringing her hands and feet Cardiovascular: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs or clicks. 2+ pulses in the dorsalis pedis and radial arteries bilaterally. Pulm: Lungs clear to ausculation builaterally  Extremities: No peripheral edema  Assessment: Ms. Cage has a past medical history of hypertension who presents today after having substernal chest pain with exertion. Her cardiovascular and respiratory exam is benign and not suggestive of heart failure or valve dysfunction. She likely has stable angina and may have coronary artery disease. It is less likely that she had a myocardial infarction, and less likely to be GERD and musculoskeletal.  Plan: She will get an EKG in the office today. A lipid panel, CBC, and BMP will be ordered. She will likely need a cardiac stress test to evaluate for coronary artery disease. She may also benefit from a statin and aspirin, pending further workup. 
2022/04/07 3:27:27 PM AST	50	Johnson	Subjective: Ms. Carla Johnson presents to the clinic today with 1 month of "feeling too tired to get things done".

She denies suicidal ideation. Unlikely to be anemic.   Plan: Treatment options were discussed with Ms. Johnson including starting an SSRI medication, which could take 6-8 weeks to show effect. We also discussed a referral to a therapist which she would like to proceed with. We will check a CBC and BMP to assess for anemia or another cause. She will return to the clinic in 6 weeks to check in on symptom improvement on the SSRI.

2022/03/29 3:54:13 PM AST	62	Williams	Subjective: Baby Boy is a 5 day old male whose father presented over zoom call with concerns that Baby Boy has been having yellow eyes. Mr. Williams describes that on the 2nd day of life, his skin started looking yellow. On day 3, they took him to the pediatrician who said it was okay and prescribed some Vitamin D drops for the baby. However, he has since continued to look yellow and has developed yellow eyes. When born, Dad does not recall the doctors mentioning jaundice. Baby Boy is breast fed and takes vitamin D drops. He does not know how much he eats. He does have 6-8 soiled diapers that are greenish yellow. The baby does not appear more fussy and he does not feel like there are any changes in how he acts. Baby has not vomitted. He has been sleeping fine and wakes up every few hours to feed. Dad is unsure of family history of jaundice but recalls that his Mom mentioned that he may have had a history of jaundice as a baby. Pregnancy and birth was largely uncomplicated except mom needed antibiotics for GBS infection. They live 20 minutes away from the hospital.  Objective: None-zoom call  Assessment: Baby Boy is a 5 day old male whose father presented over zoom call for concerns of jaundice. Most likely due to physiologic jaundice of the newborn. Less likely, Gilbert's syndrome or biliary atresia.  Plan: - We discussed with the father that the baby is having jaundice. Since parents are concerned about the progression, we talked about bringing baby into the ED to get a bilirubin level. - If bilirubin level is mildly elevated, we talked about phototherapy blanket to help reduce levels. - If bilirubin level is markedly elevated, we talked about phototherapy lights to reduce levels. - We discussed that if bilirubin levels are elevated and are not treated then there could be long-term consequences. - We will call the ED to let them know that the patient is coming in for blood level and possible admission. - Dad also had a question about weight loss at pediatrician's office. We discussed how this is normal and that by 2 weeks baby should be the same as at birth.
2022/03/29 1:33:11 PM AST	62	Smith	Subjective: Mrs. Smith is a 45-year-old female who presented to clinic today with a one day history of lower back pain.

It feels like a deep ache and is made better by resting and with the use of a heating pad. She has been using valium and Percocet that her sister in law gave her and notes that they do help her pain. Sitting, Standing, and walking make the pain worse. The pain has been affecting her sleep. She lives in a 2nd floor apartment in the Fan and this has been impacting her ability to get around. She also works for amazon and is concerned about being able to work.  This has not happened before. She has allergies to Codeine and Motrin.  Objective: Vitals: BP 120/78; HR 72; RR 16; T 98 F PE: MSK: Pain on palpation of left paraspinal muscles in lumbar region. No pain on palpation of spine; no pain on right paraspinal region; Limited ROM on spinal flexion; Full ROM of spine in all directions otherwise; Bilateral straight leg raise negative for reproduction of symptoms  Assessment: Mrs. Smith is a 45-year-old female with no pertinent past medical history here for a one day history of back pain. Most likely due to left paraspinal strain due to pain on palpation of the left paraspinal muscles. Less likely could be due to lumbar stenosis (however pain was worse with flexion) or lumbar radiculopathy (bilateral straight leg raise did not reproduce symptoms).  Plan: Back Pain - With likely diagnosis of left paraspinal muscle strain, talked about cause likely being for heavy lifting and moving around excessively yesterday when helping her dad in the yard. - No need for further imaging with physical exam findings  - Can go ahead and treat with Naproxen due to motrin allergy. Also suggested using lidocaine patches which can also be beneficial for muscle strain pain - We talked about not relying on percocet and valium due to her driving to work and using equipment in Amazon facility - Discussed plan with patient who is in agreement. Patient will call clinic again if any concerns.
2022/03/29 2:02:25 PM AST	62	Cage	Subjective: Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female with history of HTN and smoking who presented to clinic today after any episode of chest pain 3 days ago. She was carrying lots of groceries from her car when she felt a deep ache in her sternum that went away after sitting in her car for 5-10 minutes. There was no radiation of the pain and she ranked the pain at a 7/10. She has never had this exact episode before but she has had episodes of twinges previously. Nothing made it worse. She does take Chlorthalidone 25 mg and Lisinopril 10 mg every day. Family history is significant for her dad who had a heart attack in his 40s and who needed a CABG for CAD. She has been smoking 1 ppd for 30 years. She lives in the West End and works for Capital One. She is worried that she has had a heart attack.  Objective: Vital Signs: BP 150/92 HR 85 RR 14 T 98.0 PE: CV: S1 and S2 audible in all 4 fields. PMI is appropriately located in the 5th intercostal space midaxillary line. No pain on palpation of sternum. Radial pulses 2+ bilaterally. Carotids 2+ bilaterally, no bruits.  Assessment: Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female with history of HTN and smoking who presented for chest pain that happened 3 days ago. Most likely due to stable angina with history of smoking and HTN and no other episodes. Less likely unstable angina (no symptoms today) and costochondritis (no pain on palpation).  Plan: - I discussed with the patient the physical exam findings. Today's BP was elevated though patient is taking medications as prescribed. We will increase Lisinopril to 20 mg. Will check BMP in 2 weeks - We will get an exercise stress test to look for CAD especially with history of smoking 1 ppd x 30 years as well as HTN. We discussed that results could potentially show us if there has been a prior infarct - We will see pt 1 week after test.

She has also been feeling like she is not well rested. Recently, she backed up into a parked car which she feels was somewhat due to her increased fatigue. A couple weeks ago she had a stressful encounter with her 25-year-old daughter. Mrs. Johnson's husband was out of town for work and their daughter was over for dinner. Her daughter made a comment about how much wine she was drinking and Mrs. Johnson slapped her daughter in return. She has not had any changes in weight, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or tremors. She has been having headaches in the mid-morning. She smokes 1 ppd for 39 years. She drinks 5-6 glasses of wine per day. This amount increased around 7-8 months ago. She has never drunken wine in the morning. She does not view her alcohol drinking as a problem. She does not use recreational drugs. She lives in the West End with her husband and she works as a homemaker. She is most concerned about the face that she just doesn't feel like herself.  Objective: BP 120/71 HR 78 RR 14 T 98.0 F Mental Status: Mrs. Johnson had a flat affect. Her speech is appropriate. Answers questions appropriate.  Assessment: Mrs. Johnson is a 55-year-old female with alcohol use disorder here for symptoms of major depressive disorder. Most likely is having MDD secondary to alcohol use. Less likely is hypothyroidism (no systemic symptoms of low thyroid levels) and vitamin deficiencies.  Plan: - We discussed that her symptoms meet definition for MDD. We discussed that there are many secondary causes and that it could also be primary - We will get CBC, CMP, TSH, T4, B12, folate, and Vitamin D to look for any metabolic secondary causes - We also discussed that based on how much alcohol she is drinking she also fits the definition for alcohol use disorder which could certainly be contributing if not causing her MDD. Though she did not think it was a problem, she is willing to look at information about it. We will hold off on any mental health services at this time, but will provide information on alcohol use disorders. Will revisit mental health for substance use disorder after lab results return - We will start sertraline 25  mg po qd to help with MDD. We did discuss that it can take 4-6 weeks to start working - Patient will call clinic if any concerns. Will set-up referrals as needed.
2022/03/29 3:00:04 PM AST	62	Travis	Subjective: Mr. Travis is a 65-year-old male who presents to the ED for a one day history of 10/10 stomach pain. The pain began around 10 pm last night for which he took some antacids which did not make the pain better. He vomited once, but continued to be unable to sleep. It feels like a constant stabbing pain that initially started in the epigastric region but now is all over. He continues to have nausea, but no constipation, diarrhea, headaches, or subjective fever. He does not have a history of gallstones. Movement and deep breaths make the pain worse. Lying completely still makes the pain just a little bit better. He has a history of HTN and hyperlipidemia. He takes Metoprolol, Benicar, Simvastatin, Tums, and motrin or aspirin as needed. He has an allergy to penicillin. He has previously had a tonsillectomy as a child. He smokes 1 ppd x 45 years. Drinks alcohol socially 7-14 beers in a week. He works as a trucker. He is worried about needing surgery.  Objective: Vital Signs: BP 100/60, HR 110, RR 24, T 101.4 PE: Active bowel sounds. Extreme tenderness on light palpation of abdomen in all quadrants with worst pain in epigastric region. Heavier palpation was not attempted due to pain on light palpation.  Assessment: Mr. Travis is a 65-year-old male with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, and smoking who presents for stomach pain. Most likely due to some type of perforation (extreme tenderness with light palpation, nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, lower BP). Could likely also be pancreatitis (wouldn't expect diffuse abdominal pain, would expect concentrated in epigastric region) and cholecystitis (pain is diffuse around abdomen vs over gallbladder region).   Plan: - We discussed concerning signs of diffuse tenderness with light palpation as a cause of concern for perforation. We will get an Xray to rule this out/in. - Upon further exploration, pancreatitis could also be a possible diagnosis. If Xray is negative for perforation we can go ahead and get a CT scan. - We will put an IV and start fluids and pain medication. We will also keep patient NPO in either case (whether surgery or watchful waiting).
2022/03/29 3:28:14 PM AST	62	Abbott	Subjective:  Ms. Abbott is a 35 yo G1P0010 who presents to clinic for 14 days of her period not stopping. She describes it as she is "pouring out". This has never happened before. Her cycles have been unpredictable and irregular where some are short and light and some are long and heavy. There is no pattern. She has been having to use a super heavy pad and tampon and has been going through 4 each per day. She has also been having cramping that is worse than usual. She describes the bleeding as being bright red though it is usually darker. She has been taking motrin for the cramping but does not feel like it helps. Her mom did have a history of heavy periods and needed a hysterectomy a couple years ago for it. Her mom's brother is also on the list for a blood transfusion. Periods began at age 14 and have always been irregular, but she has never had issues like this with them. She is sexually active, and for the most part uses condoms for contraception but does occasionally forget. She had one episode of vaginosis in college. She had a pap smear 2 years ago and it was normal. Her main concern is that she is set to go to Madrid next week for a 3 hour presentation and she is unsure of how she will accomplish this with her current symptoms.  Objective: Vital Signs: BP 120/78 HR 72 RR 16 T 98 F Physical Exam: Abdominal: Active bowel sounds. Nontender to palpation throughout except for lower left quadrant.  Pelvic: No abnormalities noted visually. Uterus is anterior, irregularly shaped, enlarged appropriately sized at 10 weeks, no adnexal masses.  Assessment: Ms. Abbott is a 35 yo G1P0010 with family history significant for heavy periods in Mom who presents for 14 day period. Most likely due to fibroids with physical exam notable for irregularly shaped uterus. Less likely pregnancy loss and blood disorders (less likely to just start at 35 yo).  Plan: - We discussed with the patient that heavy periods with an irregularly shaped uterus could be caused by fibroids. Other causes include pregnancy or blood disorders. We will get a pregnancy test as our first step. - However, since patient has been bleeding for 14 days nonstop we will get a CBC stat to look at Hgb levels. We will also admit patient and give IV estrogen to help stop the bleeding. If Hgb is low, we can also give a blood transfusion while inpatient. - To complete workup, we will also get CMP, TSH, and T4 to look for secondary causes. A transvaginal ultrasound will also get scheduled to look for fibroids - We will see patient back in clinic after work-up is complete to discuss next steps which can include birth control (like hormonal IUD) to help regulate cycles.
2022/03/29 3:54:13 PM AST	62	Williams	Subjective: Baby Boy is a 5 day old male whose father presented over zoom call with concerns that Baby Boy has been having yellow eyes. Mr. Williams describes that on the 2nd day of life, his skin started looking yellow. On day 3, they took him to the pediatrician who said it was okay and prescribed some Vitamin D drops for the baby. However, he has since continued to look yellow and has developed yellow eyes. When born, Dad does not recall the doctors mentioning jaundice. Baby Boy is breast fed and takes vitamin D drops. He does not know how much he eats. He does have 6-8 soiled diapers that are greenish yellow. The baby does not appear more fussy and he does not feel like there are any changes in how he acts. Baby has not vomitted. He has been sleeping fine and wakes up every few hours to feed. Dad is unsure of family history of jaundice but recalls that his Mom mentioned that he may have had a history of jaundice as a baby. Pregnancy and birth was largely uncomplicated except mom needed antibiotics for GBS infection. They live 20 minutes away from the hospital.  Objective: None-zoom call  Assessment: Baby Boy is a 5 day old male whose father presented over zoom call for concerns of jaundice. Most likely due to physiologic jaundice of the newborn. Less likely, Gilbert's syndrome or biliary atresia.  Plan: - We discussed with the father that the baby is having jaundice. Since parents are concerned about the progression, we talked about bringing baby into the ED to get a bilirubin level. - If bilirubin level is mildly elevated, we talked about phototherapy blanket to help reduce levels. - If bilirubin level is markedly elevated, we talked about phototherapy lights to reduce levels. - We discussed that if bilirubin levels are elevated and are not treated then there could be long-term consequences. - We will call the ED to let them know that the patient is coming in for blood level and possible admission. - Dad also had a question about weight loss at pediatrician's office. We discussed how this is normal and that by 2 weeks baby should be the same as at birth.

2022/03/28 11:00:42 AM AST	64	Johnson	Subjective:  Ms. Johnson is a 55 year old female who presents to the clinic for fatigue.  Patient states that over the past month, she has felt very tired with "no energy, decreased libido, and increased irritability."  She states that she has felt more depressed recently, especially since her husband has been gone for the past few days on a business trip.  She adds that it has been hard to concentrate on tasks secondary to her feelings of exhaustion and even indicates that she backed into a parked car 4 days ago as a result.  She has been able to sleep through the night and denies any snoring but does not feel rested.  She does endorse headaches in the middle of the morning as well as decreased appetite. Of note, patient states that she has been drinking 5-6 glasses of wine daily for the past 7-8 months (compared to 1-2 glasses per week previously).  She indicates that her daughter had expressed that she had been drinking too much and reports that she slapped her daughter and now feels guilty.  Patient denies fever, chills, weight loss, palpitations, chest pain, SOB, abdominal pain, and changes in bowel or bladder function.  Of note, patient states that she is no longer having menstrual cycles and went through menopause 6 years ago.  Allergies - has sinus irritation in the fall  Meds - none  Past Medical History - none  Past Surgical history - none  Family history   - Father had heart attack and hypertension   - Mother has chronic pancreatitis   Social History   - Tobacco use - 1 pack / day since age of 16   - Alcohol use - 5-6 glasses of wine per day for past 7-8 months   - Denies illicit drug use  - Works as a homemaker   Objective   - Vitals      BP - 120/71, pulse 78, resp 14, temp 98   - Physical exam     General - patient appears fatigued and is soft-spoken with lack of enthusiasm in her voice; she is sitting upright on exam table but is tearful    Neck - no apparent masses or swelling; thyroid gland does not appear to be swollen    Lungs - no acute respiratory distress; lung sounds clear and vesicular in anterior and posterior fields bilaterally    Heart - regular rate and rhythm; normal S1 and S2 with no murmurs or rubs    Psych - patient endorses feeling depressed and guilty   Assessment  Ms. Johnson is a 55 year old female with no significant past medical history who complains of a 1 month history of fatigue, lack of energy, decreased libido, and irritability.  She endorses increase in alcohol intake, now drinking 5-6 glasses of wine daily for past 7-8 months and even admits to slapping her daughter when told that she was drinking too much.  Physical exam is significant for a depressed mood as well as the patient endorsing guilt for recent actions.  Patient is likely suffering from the consequences of her increased alcohol intake.  Her behavior, irritability, depression, decreased libido, and inability to concentrate could all be related to her alcohol intake.  Other considerations could be hypothyroidism causing changes in her mood and appetite.   Plan   - Help patient find counseling and psychosocial interventions including motivational interviewing and discussion meetings  - Continue to monitor patient and help discuss stages of change   - Consider BMP and liver panel to assess patient's status secondary to her drinking and decreased appetite to ensure there is not a metabolic derangement or liver dysfunction contributing to her symptoms as a result of her alcohol intake 
2022/03/28 11:56:46 AM AST	64	Abbott	Subjective:  Ms. Abbot is a 35 year old female who presents for heavy menstrual bleeding.  Patient states that she has been having heavy bleeding for the past 14 days.  She reports that yesterday, she soaked 4 big overnight pads as well as 4 tampons and still had an accident requiring her to change her clothes.  She complains of associated cramping in her lower abdomen as well as lower back spasms.  Patient has used OTC aleve q 6 hours with some relief of her lower abdominal pain.  Patient complains of associated lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue.  Of note, she endorses history of irregular menstrual cycles but otherwise denies having such long and heavy bleeding in the past.  Her last pap smear was 1.5 years ago and was reportedly normal.  She denies previous history of STDs but states that she is sexually active with her partner currently with inconsistent condom use.  She is unsure about her pregnancy status currently.  She denies nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, changes in bowel movements, chest pain, and shortness of breath.  Meds- Aleve OTC q 6 hours  Allergies - Penicillin - rash  Past Medical History - None  Past Surgical history - none  OBGYN History   - Endorses miscarriage in late 20s   - Has irregular menstrual cycles varying from 14 to 21 to 28 days between cycles; indicates that occasionally can have 5 days with heavy bleeding or 14 days with light bleeding  Family History   - Mother had hysterectomy recently due to heavy bleeding  Social History   - Denies tobacco use and illicit drug use   - Endorses glass of wine with dinner nightly   - Works as senior VP for non-profit health care organization and would like to attend a trip to Madrid in 10 days, where she will give 3 hour presentation   Objective   - Vitals - BP 120/78, pulse 72, resp 16, temp 98   - Physical Exam     -  General - patient exhibiting mild discomfort lying on her side and holding lower abdomen     - Abdomen - no apparent abnormalities on visual inspection; auscultation shows normoactive bowel sounds; tympanitic to percussion; no tenderness to palpation in RUQ and LUQ but tenderness at RLQ and LLQ    - External Genital Exam - normal    - Cervix and Vagina - normal mucosa, pink, non-tender    - Bimanual exam - uterus irregularly shaped at 10 weeks size with no masses    - Rectal exam - normal   Assessment  Ms. Abbott is a 35 year old female who presents with 14 day history of heavy menstrual bleeding that has been constant with associated cramping in her lower abdomen, back spasms in lower back, lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue.  She indicates that she has been going through 4 overnight pads and 4 tampons and still has an accident and has been using Aleve with only minimal relief.  She endorses being sexually active with inconsistent condom use with partner.  Physical exam significant for bilateral lower abdominal tenderness to palpation as well as an irregularly shaped uterus on bimanual exam that is 10 weeks in size.  The patient's presentation could be representative of a miscarriage.  This is likely based on her sexual activity and the persistent bleeding and cramping.  Other considerations could be ectopic pregnancy (which is less likely due to hemodynamic stability and lack of severe pain), irregular heavy menstrual bleeding episode (menorrhagia), uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia.    Plan   - Pregnancy Test   - Blood work (CBC, BMP) to assess electrolyte derangement and possible concern for anemia due to bleeding and fatigue/lightheadedness/dizziness      - Might consider blood transfusion is severely anemic   - Pelvic Ultrasound        - To further assess cause for bleeding 
2022/03/28 9:35:22 AM AST	65	Williams	Subjective: James Williams is a 5 day old infant that was born vaginally at 40 weeks to G1P1 mother.  Mother presents at zoom clinic today due to concerns for yellowing of skin.  Per mother, patient reportedly had "yellow skin" when leaving the hospital 4 days ago.  She visited a doctor 2 days ago and was told that it was "normal."  A "jaundice check" at that office was reportedly "normal."  Mother indicates that today, she noticed the patient's eyes to appear yellow and claims that the yellowing of the skin has been persistent without any improvement.  She indicates that the patient has been feeding well with breast milk and has good latching.  She denies any recent changes in his activity and states that he has been eating and sleeping appropriately.  Mother adds that the patient has been passing stool after each nursing and has about 8 wet diapers per day.  She reports that he was found to have lost weight at his last visit 2 days ago but there was no acute concern at that time.  Of note, mother adds that the patient has recently been congested with some sniffling and discharge.  She also adds that birth course was complicated by her being found to be GBS positive, and she indicates that she was placed on antibiotics.  She denies recent change in activity, excessive crying, fevers, chills, abdominal pain, shortness of breath, coughing, and trouble swallowing.   Medications  - Vitamin D drops once daily (quantity unknown)  Allergies  - No known allergies  Past Medical History  - No significant past medical history  Past Surgical History  - No known surgeries for patient  Family History  - Mother indicates that she reportedly had similar yellowing as a baby  - No history of liver disease, heart disease, or congenital problems  Social History  - No smoking in the home  - Mother works at an elementary school  Objective:  No available vital signs Physical Exam  - Unable to be performed as baby not present on zoom meeting  Assessment: James Williams is a 5 day old male born at 40 weeks s/p vaginal delivery to a G1P1 mother who is discussed at a zoom meeting today with mother due to concerns for 4 days of skin yellowing without recent improvement and 1 day of scleral icterus as well as recent congestion and weight loss.  Patient has been feeding well with no changes in activity and has been passing stool with each nursing episode and has 8 wet diapers per day.  No physical exam could be performed.  The patient's presentation is likely explained by neonatal jaundice due to breast milk feeding.  This is likely due to the patient's young age and status with breastfeeding as well as no acute changes in activity or status.  Alternative diagnoses could be related to liver enzyme deficiencies, blood breakdown pathologies.   Plan  - Come to clinic today for physical and observation  - Bilirubin level assessment

He endorses epigastric pain after eating lunch as well as recent episodes of minor chest pain with exertion that lasts 1-2 seconds.  Physical exam shows no significant findings.  The patient's presentation may be indicative of stable vs unstable angina due to chest pain with only minimal exertion that resolved after rest.  Other diagnoses could include stress as well as indigestion from a recent meal.  Further evaluation needed to ensure this was not an MI and to help prevent future possible MI if patient at risk.    Plan   - ECG   - Laboratory studies including CK and Troponin   - Consult with cardiology for further assessment since patient has not been evaluated by a cardiologist in past and has pertinent complaints as well as family history          - Consider stress test as well as echocardiography if needed   - Consider further evaluation for life stressors   - Consider eventual swallow study for signs of indigestion should cardiac evaluation not show any significant findings

She notes that the pain initially began in the epigastric region but now is more generalized and described as a constant stabbing rated as a 10/10 in severity.  Vitals significant for BP at 100/60, tachycardia at 110, elevated respiratory rate at 24, and fever at 101.4.  Physical exam significant for generalized tenderness to percussion and palpation.  Patient is presenting with signs of peritonitis.  Her discomfort could be secondary to pathology in the gallbladder (cholecystitis) or bile duct based on her Murphy's test, history of hypercholesterolemia and alcohol, and lack of past history of cholecystectomy.  Due to her more generalized abdominal pain, there is worry for a more acute abdomen.  Appendicitis/ruptured appendix as well as other intestinal pathology could not be ruled out on physical exam and presentation.    Plan   - Make patient NPO   - Begin IV antibiotics (Zosyn)   - Begin IV analgesic pain control   - Consider CT imaging of abdomen since patient is currently hemodynamically stable and then can proceed with OR if necessary

GI: Bowel sounds present, normoactive. Abdomen soft. Tender to palpation in RLQ, LLQ, and suprapubic.  Female GU: External genitalia appear normal. Cervix is pink without discharge or cervical motion tenderness. Uterus is anterior, irregular, and enlarged to 10 weeks of gestation. No adnexal masses.   ASSESSMENT:  Nancy Abbott is a 35-year-old healthy female who presents to clinic for evaluation of a 2-week history of abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding, most concerning for uterine fibroids. Other possible etiologies to consider include endometriosis given cramping and possible involvement of other pelvic structures given pelvic pain on palpation but less likely due to intermenstrual bleeding. Must also consider possible ectopic pregnancy due to tenderness to palpation of lower abdominal quadrants though less likely given relative chronicity of bleeding.   PLAN:  - Obtain urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy  - Obtain CBC to assess for anemia given pica symptoms and lightheadedness, fatigue as well as type and screen for possible transfusion if needed  - Perform ultrasound of the pelvis to assess uterine architecture given findings of enlarged, irregularly shaped uterus on physical exam  - Discuss use of oral contraceptives vs. implant vs. ring for regulation of menstrual cycles
2022/03/09 12:21:55 PM AST	67	Williams	SUBJECTIVE:  Baby Boy James Williams is a 5-day-old male whose mother, Tonya, is concerned about a history of yellow eyes and skin. She states that she first noticed yellowing of his skin when they first left the hospital with subsequent yellowing of the eyes first noticed this morning.

She states that the pain started yesterday after she was helping her father clean up debris in the yard. She bent over and felt a "twinge" across her lower back followed by immediate radicular pain in the L leg. She describes this pain as 8/10 and "deep and aching". She denies any numbness or tingling. She has tried using a heating pad and resting, which has not been helpful. She took some of her sister's Percocet and Valium, which provided enough relief to enable her to drive to clinic today. Sitting, standing, walking, and being active all appear to exacerbate the pain. She has never had any prior back issues.  PMHx: None SHx: None FHx: Non-contributory  Social Hx: Smokes tobacco, about 1 pack per week; drinks 1-2 beers every 2-3 days; no other drugs  Meds: None Allergies: Motrin, codeine (upset stomach)   OBJECTIVE:  Vitals: BP 120/78 P 72 R 16 Temp 98 F Physical Exam:  Constitutional: Well-appearing woman sitting towards her right side in no acute distress.  MSK: Pain with forward flexion, no pain with lumbar extension. Tender to palpation across the lower back at the level of L4-L5, L>R. No midline pain. Seated and supine straight leg raise testing is negative to 45 degrees bilaterally. Bilateral hips with normal ROM and without pain on active or passive movement. Neuro: Gait is slowed secondary to pain without evidence of foot drop or limp. 5/5 strength in all lower extremity muscles. Sensation intact throughout lower extremities.   ASSESSMENT:  Jane Smith is a 28-year-old healthy female who presents to the clinic today for evaluation of acute onset low back pain with pain radiating into the L posterior leg to the knee, concerning for sciatica given mechanism of injury and absence of neurological signs. Other etiologies to consider include lumbar disc herniation though this is unlikely given negative straight leg raise testing. Could also consider vertebral fracture, but this is very unlikely given her age and lack of midline tenderness on exam.   PLAN:  - Discussed concerns about use of sister's Percocet and Valium and the definition of true drug allergies. Discussed that upset stomach with Motrin and codeine is not an absolute contraindication to their use, but we will plan to manage pain with OTC Tylenol.  - Discussed role of physical therapy in improving pain and restoring ROM. Consider this as a possible option if no improvement after 4 weeks. In the meantime, pursue home exercise program with strengthening to address low back pain.  - Return to clinic for lumbar spine XR if no improvement after 4 weeks.  - Discussed that this is likely lumbar sciatica, which will improve with time without further interventions.

2022/03/03 11:28:00 AM AST	72	Williams	Subjective: I spoke over zoom with Mrs. Williams (1st time mother) regarding yellowing of the eyes of her 5 day old son, James Williams. She reported that she noticed yellowing of the eyes of her son this morning, which prompted her to call over zoom. She reported that James was born vaginally at full term at VCU. She reported that she was told that he was born "uneventfully," and to her knowledge, he has been completely healthy. He was born at 7lbs 6oz and currently weighs 7lbs 4oz, which has also been bothering her because she's concerned that he is not eating enough. She reported exclusively breastfeeding her son and said that he feeds consistently every 3 hours. She denied any problems breastfeeding and said that James has an appropriate latch and feeds without difficulty. She did see her Pediatrician 2 days ago for yellowing of the skin at which point he reassured her and prescribed some vitamin D. Ms. Williams also reported that both her and her son are type A+ blood.  Objective: N/A due to Zoom interview   Assessment:  James Williams is a 5 day old newborn boy who has had yellowing since birth that began with yellowing of the skin and since progressed to yellowing of the eyes today. He was born at 7lbs 6oz and currently weighs 7lbs 4oz. This is most likely appropriate development and normal physiologic jaundice because it has only been 5 days since birth. Mrs. Williams has been exclusively breastfeeding her son, which may also be causing breast milk jaundice, which is also benign. Baby James will return for a follow up at 2 weeks old, at which point I suspect the jaundice will have improved if not resolved completely. If it hasn't then further workup may be warranted. Ddx: physiologic jaundice of newborn vs. breast milk jaundice vs. Gilbert's syndrome  
2022/03/03 11:58:05 AM AST	72	Smith	Subjective:  CC: lower back pain HPI: Ms. Smith is a 33 year old female who presents with a one day history of acute lower back pain. She reported a 8/10 sharp back pain that occurred yesterday as she was helping her father with some manual labor when she felt a "twinge," in her lower back and down her left posterior thigh. She reported that she bent from the hip to lift up the object. She has been using heat pads for relief. She also got some percocet for pain and valium for sleep from a "friend." She reported that she got 4 of each and has been using them sparingly. She requested "stronger," medication for pain relief because she has to return to work in 2 days and does not believe that she could efficiently do her job in her current amount of pain. Allergies: motrin/codeine --> GI upset  Meds: none consistently PMHx: unremarkable  FHx: DM and HTN. Surg Hx: Unremarkable  SHx: -Job: stacking boxes at amazon -EtOH: 1-2 beers every few days -Tobacco: 1 pack per week - Drugs: denies   Objective: BP= 120/78 P=72 RR= 16 T = 98F Physical Exam: Cardio: RRR without abnormal sounds Chest/Lungs: CTAB MSK: No gross back deformities. Point tenderness to palpation along the lumbar spine with radiation, bilaterally. Negative straight leg tests.  Assessment: Ms. Smith is a 33 year old female who presents with a 1 day history of lower back pain following helping her father with manual labor around the house. This is most likely musculoskeletal mechanical pain secondary to a muscle strain while bending over to lift a heavy object. Physical exam notable for point tenderness on palpation of lumbar spine and unremarkable signs of radiculopathy.  DDx also includes herniated disk, spinal compression fracture, diabetic radiculopathy. Plan: - Avoid bed rest - Tylenol and moderate activity like walking and stretching  - Pain should improve in 2 weeks. If not return for further work up.
2022/03/03 12:24:48 PM AST	72	Cage	Subjective: CC: Chest pain HPI:  Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female who presents 3 days after an episode of chest pain. She reported that she was carrying groceries when she began to feel a deep squeezing midline pressure. She reported that the pain did not radiate and that she was able to get full relief after sitting in her car quietly for 5-10 minutes. She also reported roughly a 4 month history of similar episodes that occurred during physical exertion and all of which resolved with rest. This most recent episode was the worst, which prompted her visit today. She also endorsed feelings short of breath and faint during these episodes. She denied dizziness, heart palpitations or nausea during the episodes.  Allergies: None Medications: Chlorthalidone for HTN. Lisinopril for HTN. PMHx: HTN FHx: Father - hx of CABG in 30s. Died from MI at 40. Mother - DM and died of PE at 60. SHx: EtOH: Wine on weekends. Tob: 1 PPD. Drugs: Denies   Objective: BP= 150 /92 P = 85 RR = 14 T = 98F  Assessment: Ms. Cage is a 55-year-old female who presents 3 days after an acute episode of chest pain during exertion that resolved completely with rest after 5-10 mins. This is most likely stable angina given the patient's subjective report of typical chest pain symptoms with complete resolution with rest. Significant concerns for progression given her reported history of the most recent episode being the worst. Given her family history of heart disease in her father, there remains concerns for familial inherited dyslipidemia. Her history of smoking is also concerning for contribution to the disease progression. Her hypertension also seems to be uncontrolled and will warrant further workup. Will make contact with PCP for medication adjsutment. DDx includes: unstable angine, acute MI, PE, aortic dissection, esophageal spasm, hyperthyroidism Plan: -CBC with diff - CMP with hepatic panel  - Hgb A1c levels - TSH levels  - EKG to evaluate ischemic changes  - Isosorbide mononitrate today for symptomatic relief

2022/03/29 2:02:44 PM AST	73	Williams	S: James Williams is a 5 day old baby boy born at 40 weeks via SVD to a GBS+ mother who is being evaluated over Zoom for yellowing of the skin and eyes. James was not present for the visit and all history obtained through his father. James' father reports that James' skin appeared slightly yellow when he was discharged from the hospital on day 2 of life. This progressed a bit the next day, prompting him to bring James to his pediatrician who said this was expected, and they did not obtain a bilirubin level at this time. The pediatrician prescribed vitamin D drops that they have been using, however James' father states that the jaundice has continued to progress to the point that everything except the palms and soles are yellow, and today he noticed that his eyes appeared newly jaundiced as well. He additionally notes "congestion" and "sniffling" since birth, but denies known fevers, fussiness, or decreased urination. He is eating well, consuming breast milk q3h, and producing green/yellow stool after each meal. Of note, James' mom was GBS positive but reportedly received adequate antibiotic treatment during the 6-hour labor. PMHx: None diagnosed PSHX: denies PFHx: Dad--neonatal jaundice? Otherwise denies. No fhx bleeding disorders. Meds: Vit D drops Allergies: none PSochx: not pertinent O: Unable to obtain vitals or PE due to patient not present. Dad says he is appropriately interactive, no palpable abdominal masses. A: James is a 5 day old full term male born to GBS+ mother with adequate intrapartum treatment presenting with progressive jaundice and new scleral icterus. He does not have significant risk factors for hyperbili other than being male and first born child, and it is reassuring that he is still acting well, feeding well, and producing appropriate wet diapers. Although there are many benign causes of hyperbilirubinemia in a neonate including breast milk jaundice and immaturity of the conjugation system, I am concerned by the progression of jaundice and would like James to be seen to obtain a serum bilirubin and CBC to evaluate for signs of hemolysis. He should also be evaluated for sepsis given mom's GBS+ status, although it appears this was adequately reated P: - Bring James to pediatrician in person to obtain labs as above. IF no appt available, bring to nearest ER - Based on labs, James may need phototherapy or a bili blanket, or antibiotics

Given these I am concerned for stable angina, less likely that she had an acute MI given clinical presentation or unstable angina given lack of sxs at rest. Presentation not consistent with GERD but could also consider this. Her BP was also elevated in the office although this could be related to stress. I would like a repeat BP in office and she may need adjustment of antihypertensive regimen in the future. - EKG - Troponin, CK-MB - Ordering outpatient stress test  - Will likely start on aspirin 81 mg daily  - Encourage tobacco cessation - Repeat BP prior to discharge from clinic today

Most physiologic hyperbilirubinemia passes by day 4, that he is displaying new symptoms namely yellow eyes on day 5 is mildly concerning. Possibly differentials include: hemolysis, disorders of clearance of bilirubin like Gilbert or Crigler-Najar, and most likely breast milk jaundice.      Plan:  probably unconjugated bilirubinemia Lacks concerning symptoms such as fevers or chills, but would like to catch signs of hemolysis early, even if etiology is most likely breast milk jaundice. Also want baseline level of bilirubin if it increases.  -call pediatricians office for possible evaluation and labs at the end of day.  -CBC for signs of hemolysis -BMP -bilirubin for baseline

2022/03/10 10:29:41 AM AST	81	Williams	James Williams is a 5 day old male infant born at term to a G1P0 mother via normal vaginal delivery with concern for neonatal jaundice. Telehealth visit is conducted via Zoom by Mom.  Mom reports that she is concerned that James' eyes are becoming progressively more yellow. She states that she thought his skin seemed slightly yellow upon birth but was reassured by doctors that he was ok. At his 3 day check up, she brought up this concern and the doctors reportedly took a lab test that was 'normal.' Since then, Mom believes baby's eyes have become more yellow, which has prompted her concern and visit today.   She reports that she had no complications and that baby and her have the same blood type. James did not spend anytime in the NICU and did not require phototherapy in the hospital. She reports James is otherwise doing well: no fever, no inconsolable crying, breastfeeding regularly, 6-8 wet diapers daily, liquid yellow/green stools, no lethargy. Mom is ultimately concerned about 'jaundice' but does not know what this means.  Objective: unable to assess, as patient was sleeping during this telehealth visit. Will assess at follow up visit.  Assessment: James Williams is a 5 day old male infant born at term to a G1P0 mother via normal vaginal delivery without complication; mom has concern for neonatal jaundice given progressive yellowing of eyes.

2022/03/03 10:36:09 AM AST	87	Abbott	Subjective: HPI: Nancy Abbott is a 30 yo female who presents to clinic today for acute, heavy menstrual bleeding for the past 2 wks. States much heavier than her usual periods and that it came on all of a sudden. She has also had abdominal bloating, some lower back pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, and feels more thirsty than usual. Has tried Aleve but this has not helped her symptoms. Denies any other sx including nausea, vomiting, chest pain, SOB, urinary sx.   PMH: N/A Surg hx: N/A Imm: UTD, covid x3, flu shot this year allergies: penicillin social hx: no tobacco use, glass of wine daily with dinner, no recreational drug use  Objective:  VS: BP 120/78 HR 72 RR 16 T 98.0 F Physical:  Abdomen: Soft, obese abdomen, tenderness to palpation to the lower abdomen/suprapubic region, right below the umbilicus. No tenderness to any other abdominal quadrant. Normoactive bowel sounds. Pelvic exam:  External genitalia: normal in appearance Inspection of cervix and vagina: normal vaginal mucus, pink cervix, no discharge, no cervical motion tenderness Bimanual: Uterus is anterior, irregularly shaped, enlarged, ~10wks in size, no adnexal masses palpated.   Labs: none has been done but I would get a b-HCG  Imaging: none has been done but I would get a pelvic US  Assessment: 30 yo female presents to clinic for acute, heavy menstrual bleeding for 2 weeks that is unlike any period she has had in the past. Exam notable for suprapubic tenderness. Exam also notable for irregularly shaped and enlarged ~10wk size uterus. Primary differential is a leiomyoma, likely due to irregular contour of the uterus and it is enlarged as much as a gravid uterus at 10 wks. Other differentials include gravid uterus due to ~10wks size of uterus, this differential would also include spontaneous abortion due to menstrual bleeding, however this is also less likely because it has been 2 wks of heavy menstrual bleeding, and spontaneous abortion is consistent with less bleeding in the first 8 weeks of pregnancy.   Plan:  1) heavy menstrual bleeding:  -- Obtain b-HCG, always should be done for a woman of reproductive age with abdominal pain, menstrual bleeding. -- Obtain pelvic US to evaluate for leiomyoma, other pathologies -- encourage PO fluids as pt is dehydrated and losing volume -- F/u in clinic in 2wks, sooner if sx don't improve or worsen, can consider possible surgical consult at this time for removal of any pathologies found on imaging.          
2022/03/03 11:03:08 AM AST	87	Williams	Subjective: HPI: This encounter was a virtual zoom call with the newborn's mother.  Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old newborn who has had yellowing of his skin and eyes, per his mother. He began with yellowing of the skin on his first day after being born but mother states doctors were not too concerned about this and said he was safe to go home with her. However, mother states that he began with yellowing of the eyes today, 4 days after he began with the yellowing of the skin and that this is more concerning to her and is why she is calling our clinic. She states he is exclusively breastfed and cries and eats every 3hours, no change in activity or appetite. He was born full term at 40wks, mother denies being sick or having any issues with her pregnancy. States she took all her prenatal vitamins and has been giving James vitamin D drops like she was told to when he was discharged.   PMH: born at 40wks, uncomplicated pregnancy social hx: Mother does not use tobacco use, drank a couple beers at the beginning of her pregnancy when she did not know she was pregnant, otherwise no alcohol use. Mom denies recreational drug use   Objective:  Vitals and physical N/A due to virtual zoom interview with mother  Labs: none   Imaging: none   Assessment: Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old who presents via virtual zoom call with mother giving hx for 4 days of yellowing in the skin and 1 day of yellow eyes. Mother's primary concern is this yellowing of the eyes. Differential include likely etiologies including newborn jaundice,  breastfeeding jaundice or breastmilk jaundice. These are more likely etiologies as newborn does not appear toxic and continues to feed. Less likely diagnosis include Creggler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome, GALT deficiency. These are less likely due to no change in the newborn's activity, tolerates feeds well, not toxic appearing to the mother.    Plan:  1) Scleral icterus in newborn 5 day old -- Reassuremother that yellowing of the skin and eyes can be normal during the first week of a babies life and that this is due to the GI system being immature and still growing, slower at breaking down and excreting bilirubin.  -- Continue breastfeeding infant as usual, every 3 hours -- Keep scheduled newborn exam at the clinic in 1 wk -- If sx persist, can measure bilirubin level to evaluate for more serious pathologies -- Advised mother to come into clinic or the emergency department as soon as possible if baby's habits change acutely including refusing to tolerate any feeds, not crying and only sleeping, or appears toxic with fevers, grey skin.         
2022/03/03 11:31:58 AM AST	87	Smith	Subjective: HPI:  Ms. Jane Smith is a 33 yo female who presents to our clinic for low back pain that began yesterday after helping her dad in the yard with cleaning and lifting.

She has been borrowing her sister's percocet and valium which has been helping the pain and helping her sleep with the pain respectively. Denies taking over the counter NSAIDs or other meds because Motrin gives her nausea in the past. Denies any other sx including dizziness, headache, numbness/tingling, urinary problems, changes in bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or SOB. Primary concern is getting "something strong for this pain."  PMH: N/A Surg hx : N/A meds: takes percocet for pain every 6 hrs, valium at night to sleep, has only 4 pills each from sister so "trying to space them out."

Pt also can not bend too far forward when asked to reach over and touch her toes due to the low back pain. Neuro: Straight leg raise test negative, no pain on other side.   Labs: none   Imaging: none   Assessment: Ms Smith is a 33 yo female with low back pain that radiates down her L buttocks and L thigh that started yesterday when working in the yard. No  other sx. Exam notable for tenderness to low back and L paravertebral muscles low back. Primary differential diagnosis is lumbosacral strain, likely due to etiology of injury, was lifting heavy things in yard, pain came on while working in yard, also likely due to negative straight leg raise test which makes sciatica aka lumbosacral radiculopathy less likely, also pt with no numbness/tingling makes sciatica less likely. Pt also taking percocet/valium for pain and sleep, advised her of the potential increased risk of addiction and reliance on these meds for pain in the future, advised pt to try melatonin for sleep and tylenol for pain. Pt understand and was amenable to stop taking these meds for her current sx   Plan:  1) low back pain -- Give pt Tylenol, can try Toradol if tylenol does not work -- advise pt to not decrease her activity, to walk as tolerated, this will help to improve her pain over time. advise against lying in bed and being sedentary with this pain.  -- Return to clinic as scheduled f/u, sooner if notice worsening sx including urinary/bowl incontinence or loss of sensation, numbness/tingling in buttocks, or legs.

Notable for 2-3 eps of twinges past 4 months. Exam without abnormality, vitals are stable, this makes differential diagnosis of acute STEMI unlikely. She has no active sx, no diaphoresis. Unstable angina also unlikely, does not have pain at rest, only on exertion. primary diagnosis is stable angina due to episodic nature of these episodes on exertion, her fam hx of early age heart attack in father, and her smoking history increasing risk for CAD. Other diagnosis includes NSTEMI, less likely costochomndritis due to no pain on palpation of chest wall. Pulmonary embolism unlikely due to no tachycardia, tachypnea, SOB, active chest pain.   Plan:  1) Chest pain episodes on exertion -- Obtain EKG to evaluate for arrythmias, acute conduction abnormalities in heart -- Obtain serum troponin to evaluate for NSTEMI, see if she needs to go to hospital for percutaneous coronary intervention with possible stent -- CXR for episodes of chest pain with SOB that resolve -- If above results negative, set up pt with cardiology outpatient appointment due to increased risk of heart disease in fam and her smoking hx

He describes it as a heavy, deep ache at a 7/10 pain level which lasted 5-10 min. The pain did not increase or decrease. He says the pain subsided on its own after he sat down. The pain intermittently occurs when he exerts himself, per the patient. The only associated symptom reported was lightheadedness.   Medications: Chlorthiazadine and lisinopril Allergies: NKA  PMHx: Hypertension FHx: significant for myocardial infarction in father, hypertension and type 2 DM in mother.

Could also consider myocardial infarction given recurrent episodes over the last several months as well as unstable angina given the sudden onset of the latest episode. Workup should start with an EKG to rule out STEMI/NSTEMI. Pharmacologic intervention with statins, vasodilators, or beta blockers could be trialed to monitor for symptomatic improvement. Cardiology workup could follow if abnormal EKG results or inadequate symptomatic relief.

2022/03/09 3:24:15 PM AST	88	Travis	Terri Travis is a 51yo female presenting to the ED for stomach pain. This pain onset last night that she rates a 10/10 that started in the middle of her stomach but is now diffuse in the abdomen. She says she vomited last night which had a green/yellow appearance with some of her dinner in it. The pain is constant in nature. She explains that before this pain she ate a meal consisting of leftover pork chops, cabbage and iced tea. She has never experienced an episode such as this. Endorses associated symptoms of nausea, cold sweats and absence of appetite. She has had 0 bowel movements since the pain began.  Medications: metoprolol., banicar, simvastatin Allergies: Penicilin gives rash  FHx: brother has CAD, mother died from stroke, father had MI SHx: drinks 1-2 beers a day for over 20 years, smokes 1 pack of cigarettes for 45 years, denies elicit drug use PMHx: hypertension, hyperlipidemia  Vitals: BP 100/80 Pulse 100 RR 24 Temp 101.4 Physical exam remarkable for diffuse abdominal tenderness with guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no hepatosplenomegaly. Heart and lungs clear to auscultation. Skin appears flushed. Patient in distress.  Ms. Travis is a 51yo female presenting with diffuse abdominal pain onset 1 day after eating a leftover meal. Overall picture concerning for gastroenteritis, possibly bacterial in nature, given febrile temperature and symptoms. Chronic alcohol use could also make acute pancreatitis a plausible differential. Next steps should be to obtain an abdominal X ray/CT to rule out acute abdomen given guarding and intense diffuse pain. CBC, BMP, amylase/lipase, and liver function tests should also be drawn to rule out other causes of her abdominal pain as well as infection. After ruling out acute abdomen, medical workup for pancreatitis or other etiology should be pursued. Antibiotics could be initiated preemptively to cover for possible bacterial infection.
2022/03/09 3:55:54 PM AST	88	Abbott	Nancy Abbott is a 35yo female presenting with excessive menstrual bleeding for 2 weeks. She explains that her periods have always been irregular, ranging from 5 days to 2 weeks with heavy bleeding, but this one has been most severe. She is now going through 4 pads and 4 tampons per day and the bleeding has not stopped. She describes the blood as bright red with quarter sized clots. The color or quality has not changed. She has a history of 1 pregnancy that resulted in a miscarriage. In addition to the bleeding she endorses dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue and abdominal bloating. She uses Aleve for the pain which helps minimally. Pain does not radiate outside of abdomen and she denies other associated symptoms. She has not taken a pregnancy test.  Medications: Aleve Allergies: Penicillin gives rash  PMHx: N/A FHx: Mother had hysterectomy from bleeding, uncle had transfusion for blood disorder SHx: 1 glass of wine with dinner, no tobacco, denies drugs. Lives by herself in apartment. Has boyfriend she is sexually active with, uses condoms inconsistently. 6 total sexual partners. 1 pregnancy resulting in miscarriage.  Vitals: BP 120/78 Pulse 72 R 16 Temp 98F Physical exam remarkable for tender left and right lower abdominal quadrants with light and deep palpation. Pain in bilateral adnexa and uterus to palpation. Bowel sounds normal. Heart and lung sounds normal. Skin turgor normal. Pulse 2+. *Would have conducted pelvic exam given presentation*  Ms. Abbott is a 35yo female presenting with signs concerning for dysmenorrhea. She has a history of irregular periods but this instance has not resolved and she has bled profusely for 2 weeks. Symptoms could be of primary etiology but we cannot yet exclude uterine or cervical pathology given her sexual activity and premenopausal age. A pregnancy test should be administered before any treatment to rule out terminated pregnancy/miscarriage. She should be seen by a gynecologist to conduct a full exam and possibly an ultrasound to assess intraabdominal/pelvic disease. OCPs could be given if primary dysmenorrhea as well as NSAIDs to control her pain. One might also conduct a coagulation study and CBC on the patient given her unclear family history of bleeding disorders. Iron supplementation could also be considered given her symptoms suggestive of anemia due to the blood loss.
2022/03/09 4:26:12 PM AST	88	Williams	James Williams is a 5 day old male (born 39 weeks via SVD) presenting over Zoom by mother, Tanya, for yellowing of the eyes. Mother explains that baby was yellow after birth but about 4 days ago his eyes began to turn yellow. She also endorses that the patient has exhibited congestion since birth. She explains that delivery and pregnancy were both uncomplicated aside from a positive GBS for which she was treated before delivery. Mother also endorses that she was also yellow at birth which resolved. Baby James has since been eating appropriately every 3 hours, is breastfeeding well, produces 6-8 wet diapers daily, sleeps well and is gaining good weight. He produces good urine and bowels daily. He has no evidence of bruising or bleeding and does not exhibit symptoms of lethargy. Mother also denies other associated symptoms in baby such as cough, nasal discharge, or diarrhea.  Mother does not take medications. Baby is taking Vitamin D drops. **Should have asked if baby received Vitamin K injection at birth** **Should have asked about ABO compatibility** No known allergies.  PMHx: unremarkable in mother or son FHx: unremarkable SHx: unremarkable  Vitals unavailable Mother endorses no change in physical exam since birth. No signs of hematomas, bleeding, or bruising. No rash. Only remarkable PE finding is jaundice of the eyes.  James Williams is a 5 day old male presenting with jaundice of the eyes. Mother and son attended follow-up Pediatric appointment where baby was assessed and deemed normal. As newborns transition out of womb, jaundice can be cyclical as their red blood cells are immature and break down quicker than adults. Baby has not shown symptoms of decreased feeding, stooling, nutrition, or energy status. Family history not significant for bleeding disorders, but must be considered given unknown Vitamin K status (I should have asked). Assuming bilirubin levels were deemed normal and risk was low at birth, there is no indication for acute admission or ED visit. Close follow up with Pediatrician for routine checkups and vaccinations should be the next step. Advised mother to monitor for changes in baby's energy level and feeding as these findings could be indicative of more serious causes of jaundice. Continued good feeding and nutritional habits If jaundice worsens or does not resolve with time, Hematology workup could be pursued. Cannot rule out ABO incompatibility given limited information about hospital course.
2022/03/09 4:55:55 PM AST	88	Smith	Jane Smith is a 29yo female presenting with lower back pain onset 1 day ago. Yesterday, she was assisting her father with yard work when she felt soreness in her back. This feeling then progressed to a "twinge" as she bent over. The pain is now constant and the patient rates it at an 8/10 intensity. Its quality is described as a deep ache. The pain is located across the patient's lower back and it radiates down the back of her left leg. The pain is worse with all of her movements but she is able to walk if she does so slowly. She has been taking her sister's leftover Valium and Percocet which she says has helped the pain. She has tried other remedies that have not worked. An episode such as this has not occurred before.  Medications: N/A Allergies: Motrin and Codeine result in GI upset  PMHx: N/A FHx: Diabetes in mother, hypertension in father SHx: works stacking boxes for Amazon. Drinks 2-3 beers 2x per week. Smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per week for 10 years. Denies elicit or recreational drug use.  Vitals: BP 120/78 Pulse 72 RR 16 Temp 98F Physical exam remarkable for paraspinal tenderness to palpation across lumbar spine. Pain on forward bend. Muscle strength 5/5 in all extremities. Pain on extension of hip but full range of motion in other extremities. Gait stiff.   Jane Smith is a 29 year old female presenting with back pain onset 1 day ago after assisting father with yard work. Patient has radiating pain down left leg concerning for nerve involvement from possible disc herniation. Compression spinal fracture must also be considered given precipitating physical activity. Being as though patient is still able to function and is not disabled by the pain, conservative treatment should be initiated before pursuing neurological workup. NSAIDs such as Naproxen could be trialed for symptomatic relief and to allow for healing. Physical therapy could also prove effective in terms of improving mobility and pain. If symptoms do not improve, spinal imaging including X ray or MRI could be pursued to assess for structural damage or nerve involvement (sciatica). Steroid injections could also be pursued as therapy if spinal/neurologic pathology is found on imaging.

Objective: Vitals BP - 120/78 Pulse - 72 RR - 16 Temp - 98  PE - Patellar reflexes +2 bilaterally, achilles reflex +2 in right and unable to solicit in left - Gait is slow - No leg length discrepancy - Lower back tender to palpation bilaterally but more on left  Assessment: Patient is a 28yo F w/ no PMH who presents with low back pain bilaterally that radiates down her posterior left leg to the knee. The pain is likely related disc herniation as she was lifting something doing yardwork when she felt an acute onset of pain with radiation down the leg which is suggestive of nerve entrapment. Very unlikely to be malignant process as patient has never experienced this before and has no constitutional symptoms to suggest a malignant process in the bone which may predispose her to fracture.  Plan: - Initial conservative treatment w/ NSAIDs and activity modification - If that fails, will consider PT and possible imaging depending on progression or resolution of symptoms
2022/03/09 12:26:40 PM AST	91	Cage	Subjective: Patient is 46yo M/ w/ PMH who presents to clinic with recent chest pain. The patient states he was carrying groceries to his car when he felt a sudden, deep ache that was heavy and he had to put his groceries down and sit in his car and rest for 5-10 min which rsolved the symptoms. He felt lightheaded and like "the wind was knocked out of him" but no SOB. He reports having similar symptoms w/ exertion over the last 4 months that only lasted a few seconds. He states that his father had an early MI at 40 that required bypass surgery.   Objective: Vitals: Temp - 98 P - 85 R - 14 BP - 150/92  Meds: Clorthalidone, Lisinopril  PMH: HTN  Fam History: Father - MI in mid 40s s/p bypass surgery  PE: Heart: RRR, clear s1/s2 w/ no m/r/g Lungs: CTAB  Assessment: Patient is a 46yo M w/ PMH of HTN who presents to clinic with recent chest pain. The pain occurs during exertion and the most recent was described as a sudden, deep ache that feels heavy with associated lightheadedness and resolved after 5-10 minutes of rest. The pain was non-positional without associated SOB. He began having symptoms about 4 months ago while exerting himself but they only lasted a few seconds. His father had an MI in his mid-40s and required bypass surgery. This patient's pain is likely stable angina 2/2 a hereditary condition due to his chest pain only during exertion that resolves with rest and his father having an MI at a young age. The patient also endorsed a feeling of fullness/pressure in the midsternal region following a large meal on occasion so patient's symptoms could possibly be related to GERD, but unlikely as patient's previous meal prior to the last episode was about 4 hours prior.   Plan: - EKG - Stress test - CBC / CMP - Lipid panel - Discuss with patient possibility of including his father in discussion to see if genetic component is at play - If all of this is negative consider upper endoscopy to assess for GERD or other etiologies of chest pain

2022/03/10 11:28:10 AM AST	94	Williams	Subjective HPI: Mr. James Williams is a 5 day old boy born to a G1P1 mother who presented to virtual clinic with yellowing of the skin and eyes. He has had yellow skin since birth and the mother noticed the sclera was yellow bilaterally yesterday. He has no systematic signs of infection. He is feeding (breast milk every three hours), voiding (6-8 wet diapers/day), and stooling (after every feed) well. His current weight has decreased by 2 ounces from birth weight (7lbs and 6 ounces), which is less than 10%. She is concerned that this may be hurting him and is abnormal.   Medications: Vitamin D drops Allergies: none Pregnancy: uncomplicated, good prenatal care Delivery: spontaneous vaginal delivery, GBS+ treated with penicillin  Postpartum: no complications  FHx: mother (alive, "yellow baby," unsure of cause)  Objective Vitals: N/A since it was virtual visit Physical exam: N/A since it was a virtual visit Labs: none Imaging: none  Assessment/Plan Mr. James Williams is a 5 day old baby boy born to a G1P1 mother via spontaneous vaginal delivery complicated by GBS+ treated with penicillin. His postpartum care is notable for yellowing of the skin and eyes without any other systemic signs and in the setting of adequate feeding, voiding, and stooling. This is most likely due to newborn physiologic jaundice due to immature liver at birth. Other differential diagnoses include hereditary causes of jaundice, such as Gilbert or Criggler-Nager, given similar symptoms of mother at baby; however, these are less likely since mother does not experience such symptoms in adulthood. - Discussed newborn physiologic jaundice with the mother and consoled her that this is a benign condition that resolves by two weeks - Schedule a follow-up appointment in two-three weeks to examine the infant and do a wellness visit  - Give anticipatory guidance for first time mothers

A: Ms. Cage is a 55 year old female smoker who has a history of hypertension and a family history of a father who had CAD and bypass before the age of 45 who presents with an episode of substernal chest pain following exertion with no sweating, nausea, or left arm pain and relieved by rest. Exam is significant for elevated BP. The most likely diagnosis is stable angina. An MI is less likely given her relief of symptoms with rest and a panic attack is less likely given her absence of a history of anxiety.  P: -She should present to the ED for a cardiac workup including troponins, CXR, EKG, and potentially a cardiac cath. -If she is found to have only angina and not a more severe form of ACS, nitroglycerin could be used to relieve her chest pain symptoms.  -Given her elevated BP and history of HTN, a repeat BP should be obtained. If it remains elevated, this indicated that her HTN is poorly controlled and a third medication such as a calcium channel blocker can be added.  -Smoking cessation was discussed with the patient. 
2022/03/04 4:27:09 PM AST	99	Johnson	S: Ms. Johnson is a 55 year old female with a noncontributory medical history who presents with 1 month of feeling "too tired."  She is irritable, finds it hard to concentrate, and has been feeling generally depressed for the past month. She reports a low libido, but states that she can enjoy some activities as she usually does, though her fatigue interferes with this. She endorses guilt about not doing more volunteer work as well as regarding a fight that she had with her daughter in relation to Ms. Johnson's drinking. She is able to sleep, but does not feel rested in the morning. She has not had a great appetite, but has not noticed any weight loss.  Nothing like this has ever happened before and there was no context at the beginning of the month to contribute to these feelings. She denies any history of anxiety or symptoms concerning for mania.   She notes that she has been drinking 5-6 glasses of wine per day for the last 7-8 months. She has not thought about cutting back, feels guilty about the argument she had with her daughter regarding drinking, feels angry when people challenge her on her drinking, and does not drink in the morning. She states that alcohol helps her to feel calm and that she enjoys the way that it makes her feel.   O: VSS Mental status: She appears depressed with an affect congruent to mood. She denies any SI, HI, or AVH. Her conversation is logical and linear. Her attention is intact to conversation. Her insight is fair, but her judgment is poor in regards to her drinking.  A: Ms. Johnson is a 55 year old female with no relevant PMH who presents with one month of fatigue and symptoms concerning for depression. Exam is congruent with this. The most likely diagnosis is MDD. A substance-induced mood disorder is likely a component given her excessive alcohol intake. Bipolar disorder is less likely given absence of previous symptoms concerning for mania, but cannot be ruled out.   P: -The possibility of starting an antidepressant was discussed with the patient. -The potential contribution of alcohol to the patient's symptoms was discussed with her. The possibility of reducing alcohol was discussed with her. -Given her lack of suicidality and no evidence for weight loss, she should be safe to treat in the outpatient setting. She was counseled that, should she have thoughts of harming herself or anyone else, she should go to the ED for further treatment. 
2022/03/04 4:55:00 PM AST	99	Travis	S:  Ms. Travis is a 60 year old female with a history of HTN and HLD who presents due to pain in her "stomach." She states that she had a late dinner and began to feel sharp pain in her abdomen around 10pm. She thought it was indigestion, which she gets from time to time, and took a tums, then vomited around midnight. She states that the vomit was yellow-green with no evidence of blood. Her pain started in the upper middle of her abdomen and is now constant and stabbing everywhere. She states that she is feeling cold and sweaty "all over" and has no appetite. She had her last bowel movement yesterday and denies any blood in her stool. She is still nauseated, but does not feel lightheaded and is not sure if she feels feverish. She drinks 1-2, maybe more beers per day. She takes motrin and aspirin at times for headaches. She denies any history of reflux or appendicitis.   O:  BP: 100/60 Pulse: 110 Resp: 24 Temp: 101.4 degrees F  Abdominal: Her bowel sounds are normoactive. Her abdomen is diffusely tender to even mild palpation. The exam is limited by pain, but guarding does not seem to be present.   A: Ms. Travis is a 60 year old female who presents with severe abdominal pain that was initially localized to the epigastric area, but then became diffuse and is associated with feeling cold and diaphoretic throughout. Exam is significant for vital signs concerning for potential hemodynamic instability as well as meeting of SIRS criteria. The most likely diagnosis is perforation of an ulcer given her history of indigestion, her alcohol intake, and her pattern of localized followed by diffuse abdominal pain. Given the epigastric origin of her pain and her ethanol intake, appendicitis is another possibility. Less likely is appendicitis, given the localization of her symptoms, though fever does support this.   P:  -Obtain an upright abdominal X-ray to evaluate for free air in the abdomen. -If she is hemodynamically stable enough, obtain an urgent CT scan. -Given the potential hemodynamic instability and her meeting of SIRS criteria, obtain a CBC to evaluate her hemoglobin and hemotocrit and evaluate her white count.   -Begin empiric antibiotics given that she meets SIRS criteria.  -Obtain amylase and lipase to determine if she may have appendicitis. -Given the concern for an acute abdomen, be prepared to perform an ex lap.

Meds/allergies: none Fhx: mother reports having yellow skin and eyes at birth  Objective Vitals: none Physical Exam: none 2/2 virtual visit with mother Labs: none  Assessment 5 day old baby boy following pregnancy with +GBS treated with antibiotics presenting with jaundice since birth and new scleral icterus since this morning. History is consistent with unconcerning jaundice due to lack of fever, consistency of breastmilk feedings, and lack of other concerning symptoms. Suspect likely physiologic jaundice vs transient familial hyperbilirubinemia due to family history of similar symptoms in mother as a newborn and no evidence of any other concerning symptoms or fevers. Less likely GBS meningitis due to absence of fevers or poor feeding, as well as mother receiving antibiotic treatment during pregnancy. Unlikely kernicterus due to regular feeding, appropriate weight of the child and short course of the jaundice in a newborn <7 days old.  Plan: 1) Close follow up in clinic for bilirubin blood draw in the next 2 days 2) Report immediately to the ED if any other concerning symptoms develop 3) Discuss possible genetic testing for causes of jaundice if mother is interested in pursuing further causes

Differential Diagnoses at this point include inheritable coagulopathies, less likely due to no other signs of platelet/clotting malfunction. Structural changes in the uterus could also contribute to her bleeding, but less likely due to no concern from gynecologic standpoint. A hormonal imbalance could also be contributing to her heavy bleeding because of the intervals at which her period comes.   Plan - Contact gynecologist to rule out structural abnormalities, ultrasound may be necessary  - Labs to rule out coagulopathies like Von Willenbrand, Antithrombin deficiency etc  - CBC to assess anemia and on decision if transfusion will be necessary.  - Supportive care for dizziness and fatigue,   Medical Student, Kimaya Council

Most likely physiologic jaundice of the newborn given healthy birth history, normal stool coloration, and overall happy baby. Less likely Criggler-Najar, Gilbert's Syndrome, Dubin-Johnson Syndrome or Rotor's, will obtain labs to assess. Other possibility is breast milk jaundice, though patient is not old enough to assess for this. Less likely breastfeeding failure jaundice giving history of normal feeds. Re-assured mother that this is likely normal course of newborn, but will obtain labs and perform PE given that she is unsure of what labs were obtained at OSH.  Plan: - Obtain labs as above. - Have patient and mother come in for labs/physical to re-assure mom.
2022/03/03 10:35:38 AM AST	119	Williams	CC: â€œMy baby is yellowâ€ HPI: 5 day old male seen via telehealth exam, mom G1P1 is concerned because babyâ€™s skin has been yellowing over the past 4 days since hospital discharge, and yesterday (day of life 4) she noticed yellowing of the eyes.  - Prenatal history unremarkable. Mom states that the pregnancy was uneventful. Born full term.  - Mom endorses regularly going to checkups and that baby has had a healthy prenatal and perinatal course thus far - Last time seeing the doctor was 2 days ago, they said he had lost a little weight but was within normal limits for newborn  - She cannot remember if they measured his bilirubin at that visit.  - He feeds every 2-3 hours. Exclusive breastfeeding. Mom says lactation saw them in hospital and he appears to latch okay and get enough to eat with each feeding - She states he has a wet/soiled diaper after almost every feeding (>6-7 per day); she says the stools were initially black and tarry but have become yellow/seedy - She is concerned that she may need to supplement with formula   ROS: denies lethargy, denies change in behavior; denies fever; denies change in appetite/amount eaten; endorses yellowing of skin, yellowing of eyes; endorses weight loss  Physical exam: limited by telehealth visit  A/P: 5 day old male born at term to G1P1 mother with unremarkable prenatal and birth history seen by telehealth visit due to motherâ€™s concern for progressive yellowing of skin and eyes. Exclusively breastfed, last seen in clinic 2 days ago when she was told that he was losing weight but within normal limits for newborn. No change in behavior, still stooling and urinating normally.  Jaundice - DDX: breastfeeding jaundice vs. normal physiologic jaundice of newborn  o Recommended mom following up in clinic today or tomorrow to get weight, more detailed feeding history, and do bili check. Counseled mom on red flag signs/reasons to go to the ER. Let her know that I would speak with attending physician to ensure there was no reason to come emergently to the ER and contact her promptly to schedule appointment or with further instructions.  o Counseled mom on physiologic jaundice vs. breastfeeding jaundice, told her that weight loss is normal for first 2 weeks of birth but that it should be monitored closely and we expect weight to be back to birth weight within 2 weeks  - Breastfeeding o Mom has vitamin D drops at home  o Schedule lactation consult at outpatient clinic visit to ensure proper latch and adequate milk  o Supplement formula as needed, told mom that at this time she could hold off on purchasing to facilitate breastfeeding development and bonding but that we would readdress when we next saw her in clinic  Kristen Lospinoso, M3

CV exam and pulm exam WNL, no tenderness of the anterior chest wall, no edema or cyanosis of the extremities.  #Chest pressure - DDX: angina vs. arrhythmia o Discussed differential with patient, advised that though symptoms are reassuring that less likely to be emergent at the present time, we need to do more workup to ensure no underlying heart condition on top of HTN. With family history, need to rule out structural heart disease.  o Order EEG. Draw lipid panel, troponins, CBC w/diff, BMP o A1C due to risk factors. Patient may need statin therapy if lipid profile supports.  o Echo if concerns on EEG  o HTN counseling: not well controlled on current regimen. Diet counseling and exercise counseling.

Mom states that he has not had any trouble breathing and does not seem to be running a fever, but she has not checked his temperature. He does have yellowing of the skin and eyes, but she has not noticed any drainage or swelling of his eyes.  Assessment: James is our 5 day old M who's mother is concerned of new onset jaundice. He has been feeding consistently without any issues, is the same blood type as his mother, and has not been running a fever per Mom. Jaundice due to ABO mismatch is less likely due to same blood type as mother and breast feeding jaundice is less likely as he is feeding consistently. Physiologic jaundice is most likely cause as it is more common, but more serious causes, such as biliary atresia, need to be first ruled out.  Plan: - Bring James to pediatrician for in-person assessment and physical exam - Obtain abdominal ultrasound to rule out biliary atresia - Measure bilirubin levels

Objective No allergies  Meds: vitamin D  PE: scleral icterus, yellowing of the skin profusely  Unable to do complete physical exam since it was virtual  Assessment  James is a 5 day old previously healthy male presenting with yellowing of the skin and eyes. He has no other associated symptoms and is exclusively breast fed. Most likely diagnosis is breast milk jaundice since he is exclusively breast fed. It also could be breast feeding jaundice, however this is less likely since mom is feeding at regular intervals so he should be getting enough calories. Mom does mention he lost some weight, however it is normal for babies to loose 10% of their body weight in the first few days of life. On the differential is also physiologic jaundice since he is in that age category and may not have enough enzymes to conjugate bilirubin. Biliary atresia is less likely since he does not have belly pain or excess fussiness. Crigler-Nagar, Rotar, Gilberts are on the differential. Hemolysis is a less likely cause of jaundice since he is not excessively tired or pale.   Plan - Come in to the office for a physical exam and labs tomorrow - Order bilirubin levels  - Follow up with results.

No bulging discs on palpation. Normal curvature of the spine when standing, bending forward and bending side to side makes the pain worse. No bruising or discoloration of the back.  Assessment  Ms. Smith is a 33 yo F with no significant PMHx who presents with one day of LBP after lifting a tree branch. PE significant for pain on palpation. Top differential is a muscle strain of the lower back. This is most likely as the pain is reproduced on palpation and is worse with movement. Also she got the injury while lifting and felt the muscle pop. Herniated disc is on the differential but is less likely since there is no bulging disc on palpation, however it is on the differential since she has pain in her left leg. However, the pain could be referred from the strained muscle. Sciatia is on the differenial as she has pain in her left leg. Spinal stenosis is less likely as she has no focal neurological deficits. Vertebral fracture is less likely as she has no step offs and the mode of injury is not indicative of facture, she is also young and less likely to have a compression fracture.

Differential includes breastfeeding jaundice due to history of breastfeeding (less likely due to timeframe of starting in first few days after birth), hemolytic jaundice (less likely as same blood type), and obstructive jaundice (less likely as no acholic stools). Less likely hereditary enzyme deficiency jaundice. Since parent has concerns still and the serious side effects of kernicterous if jaundice is pathological patient should come into clinic or ER for blood draw and evaluation.  Plan: 1. Mother agreeable to bring patient in today to clinic for labs and examination 2. CBC, BMP, Hepatic Panel (including T bili and D bili levels). Physical examination and vitals. 3. Counseled mother on different causes of jaundice. Can expand further once testing is returned 4. Request hospital and pediatrication records to trend bilirubin levels and get further OB/GYN info

2022/03/22 1:30:39 PM AST	143	Williams	S: James Williams is a 5 day old boy who presents by his mother for an evaluation due to jaundice - yellowing of skin and eyes. Mom presented for virtual visit today, James was out with his father and was not present during the encounter. Mom reports that James was born via vaginal delivery, full term without complication. GBS status + treated appropriately with abx. Mom and baby are both blood type A-. Birth weight was 7 lbs and 6 oz most recent weight two days ago was 7 lbs and 4 oz. Mom inquired about adding formula due to weight loss. Encouraged Mom to continue breast feeding. Mom reports no difficulties with breast feeding, no latch difficulty, no apparent difficulty in tolerating feeds which occur on demand ever 3 hours. Mom was asking since mother in law was concerned about weight loss. I advised her to continue without formula for now. Mom reports 6-8 wet diapers daily with soiled diapers as well. Otherwise James seems to be doing fine. Mom reports possible congestion, rhinorrhea bilaterally with clear drainage. No other concerns.

P: - Check bilirubin level to see if unconjugated or conjugated bili is elevated. If direct is elevated, would plan HIDA scan, hepatic U/S. Per mom's hx, baby does not seem toxic appearing so less concern for sepsis eval. - If indirect is elevated, would check hgb since coombs test is less likely given identical blood type. If High hgb,  possible blood transfusion pathology including maternal baby, or delayed cord clamping (vaginal delivery) - If normal hgb, check retic count, if negative likely breast feeding or breast milk jaundice, if positive, possible hemolysis and would proceed with work up for spherocytosis, G6PD disease or Pyruvate Kinase Deficiency - Though weight loss in the initial days of common, if baby continues to lose weight possibility that breast feeding juandice more likely. Mom not having difficulty feeding at this time. She is a first time mom. If concern, could consult for lactation consult for further assistance.

Mom not having difficulty feeding at this time. She is a first time mom. If concern, could consult for lactation consult for further assistance.

Labs: none to review but mom reports all normal at hospital and pediatrician the other day   Assessment: Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old male who presents with acute yellowing of the skin and eyes since leaving the hospital. Most likely neonatal jaundice given the yellowing of skin and eyes. More specifically could be breastfeeding jaundice if he is not getting adequate feedings. Could be Crigler-Najjars though unlikely given no family history of it. Could be Gilbert's given congestion could be a trigger.  Plan: 1. Reassured mom this is a common finding and normal in newborns and that she should not worry unless things do not resolve within a few days or worsen or if he becomes drowsy, agitated, or she notices any other concerning findings 2. Reassured mom baby's losing weight after a few days is normal and to expect him to return to BW by 2 weeks and to call if he doesn't and/or continues to lose weight or does not take to his feeds any more.

2022/02/28 11:37:14 AM AST	144	Smith	CC: low back pain  HPI: 28yo F presents with 1 day of deep aching back pain rated as 8/10. She was helping her da din the yard yesterday and bent down to pick something up when she felt a twing. She says the pain is on both sides in her lower back and goes down the left leg to just above her knee. She has relief with heating pads and rest. Her friend gave her some Percocet and Valium for pain relief and she has been taking those of unknown quantities but they are helping. She has never taken opioids in the past or other medications like these. ROs otherwise negative.  Fam hx: denies any cancer or back problems  Meds: none besides Percocet and Valium of unknown quantities Allergies: Motrin and Codeine (makes her feel sick)  Physican Exam:   VS: 120/78, 72, 16, 98  CV: RRR, no murmurs,. rubs, gallops Lungs: CTAB MSK: intense tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spinous processes and mild tenderness to palpation of the paraspinal muscles in this region. Straight leg test was negative bilaterally. No tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanters bilaterally. (should have done a ROM back test but ran out of time)  Assessment: Ms. Jane Smith is a 28yo F who presents with acute aching back pain following an attempt to lift while doing yardwork. Most likely a herniated disc given the central location of pain to palpation and the pop with pain down her leg. Les likely sciatica given the negative straight les test even in the presence of pain down her leg. Could be vertebral fx though rare in this young female. Possibly a muscle strain though pain was more severe over the processes than the paravertbral muscles and she felt a twing.  Plan: 1. Counseled the patient on her current pain medications and agreed to stop taking these given the risk for addiction and instead agreed to try extra strength tylenol as she cannot take NSAIDs 2. Obtain x-ray of back/spine to start 3. Will schedule an MRI of the back/spine if the x-ray is negative 4. Advised patient to continue using heat packs that helped and to rest and abstain from heavy lifting for a few weeks 5. Work note limiting lifting of any kinds since she does this at her job for at least 4 weeks. Can reassess this after a month and extend as needed but she can do other tasks at work to get paid still.
2022/02/28 12:04:27 PM AST	144	Cage	CC: chest pains  HPI: 46yo M presents with recurring chest pains. He has had short epidosed of chest pain centrally located in the past while running or stair climbing that resolve on their own.

Most likely stable angina for the chest pains on exertion and GERD for the chest pressure after big meals. Possibly NSTEMI or STEMI but would need EKG for this. Less likely respiratory related like PE given they self resolve quickly.  Plan: 1. EKG as soon as possible to assess heart; also troponin given only a few days out from event and could still see elevation 2. Nitroglycerin sublingual tabs instructed to be used if the pain does not resolve on its own after a few minutes and to take another if persistent after 15 minutes and to call 911 at this time 3. recheck BP and monitor, may need to add a medication on top of regimen 4. Trial PPI (pantoprazole 40mg PO daily) for GERD 5. Counseled to avoid laying down or going to bed after big meals to limit GERD symptoms too
2022/02/28 12:32:26 PM AST	144	Johnson	CC: "too tired to do anything"  HPI: 55yo F presents with lack of energy every day for the past month.

Assessment: Ms Carla Johnson is a 55yo F presenting with one month of depressed mood, loss of interest, insomnia, loss of energy, diminished ability to concentrate. Most likely major depressive disorder given the 5 items present from the DSM5 criteria. Possibly secondary to her drinking which began before these symptoms so a substance use disorder.  Plan: 1. Proposed reducing drinking to the patient met with major resistance which I rolled with and left an option to return to talk about this at any point and planted seeds to look for other ways it is affecting her life 2. Start therapy/counseling which the patient was interested in 3. Start fluoxetine 10mg PO daily and will titrate with follow-up in 4 weeks to see if any affects noticed- advised affects may take 4-6 weeks
2022/02/28 12:59:56 PM AST	144	Travis	CC: stomach pain  HPI: 60yo F presents with severe 10/10 diffuse abdominal pain she describes as sharp.

CV: RRR, no murmurs,. rubs, gallops Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds, severely tender to light palpation in all four quadrants. Could not assess any further given the pain.  Assessment: Ms Terri Travis is a 60yo F presenting with severe, acute, diffuse, and sharp abdominal pain with an episode of emesis and the presence of chills and a fever. Most concerning for peritonitis given fever and diffuse sudden onset abdominal pain elicited with the lightest of palpation;  could be secondary to pancreatitis or bowel perforation. Possibly bowel obstruction given the emesis. Could also be gastritis though the pain is no longer only epigastric and she only vomited once with no diarrhea.  Plan: 1. Abdominal x-ray to rule out perforation - go directly to OR for ex lap if present 2. CT scan if x-ray is normal 3. CBC, CMP, amylase, lipase 4. 2 large bore IVs for fluids 5. start antibiotics via IV access 6. Start extra strength Tylenol for pain with possible need to escalate to narcotics if no relief

2022/03/14 9:32:56 AM AST	151	Williams	S: HPI - James is a 5 mo old M who's mom is concerned that his eyes are yellow. She says he has been a yellow baby since birth, but just yesterday she noticed that his eyes are starting to turn yellow. The only other symptoms that she noticed are some congestion and runny nose that have been present since birth as well. He is an otherwise healthy baby. She denied that he ever had any fevers, fussiness, or change in appetite or alertness. He has lost 2 oz since birth. She did not recall if baby was tracking on birth charts, but her pediatrician made no indication he was SGA. Mom had an uncomplicated birth and pregnancy, except was treated with abx for GBS+ status. She is O+.   FMH: Mom says that her mom reported she had yellow eyes as a baby, but wasn't sure they ever did anything about it.   O: VS n/a PE: pt not present on call, reported scleral icterus per mom  A: Pt is a 5 days old M who has had reported jaundice and URI-like symptoms since birth, now progressing to scleral icterus. He is an otherwise healthy baby that is breastfeeding. Differential Dx most likely is Gilbert's syndrome, as the infant sounds well-appearing other than the jaundice, plus sounds like mother has similar hx and it has an AD inheritance. Other considerations would be physiologic jaundice, breast milk jaundice (she is breastfeeding), crigler-najjar (he would be far more sick appearing), hemolysis, or breastfeeding jaundice (he would be more sick appearing).   P:  Get CBC to assess for RBC  Bilirubin levels (TSA) LDH - assess for hemolysis Counseled mother about signs to warrant ED visit, will reach back out to her after confirming the plan with Pediatric Attending.

Right now, diff dx most likely is substance use disorder, given heavy alcohol consumption. According to DSM, a dx of MDD cannot be given in the context of other substance use, even though she does meet the criteria for a depressive episode. Bipolar seems less likely given no hx of mania.  P: -refer to cognitive behavioral therapy -counsel about substance use -SSRI (consider) -counseled that treatment is shared decision making, and that she has a say in what she would like to try, pt says she was open to treatment recommendations.

Diff dx is high for acute gastroenteritis 2/2 to improperly stored and consumed pork, but bilious emesis and PE findings prompt for further workup. Other dx include peritonitis, acute cholecystitis (bilious emesis, high cholesterol and fatty food consumption), or appendicitis.  P: -BMP and CBC, Ca, Mg, PO4 -CT abdomen to assess gallbladder and appendix -zofran for nausea -discuss pain control options with residents, she is in severe and acute pain so opiates would be appropriate, but need to balance with side effects of slowed GI motility and potential nausea.

Right now given, PE findings of enlarged uterus and sexual hx, a miscarriage is high on the diff dx. Other important dx to consider are fibroids given irregular contour and heavy bleeding, endometriosis, or adenomyosis are other causes of heavy menstrual bleeding + irregular periods.   P: -CBC to assess for anemia, if anemic supplement iron, if critical then go to ED -Urine pregnancy test +/- uterine US depending on HcG result

She is currently taking percocet (1-2pills every 4-6 hours for pain) and valium (1-2 pills before bed for sleep) that she got from a relative as needed. She's allergic to motrin and codeine- causes stomach upset/vomiting. Patient is concerned for main management to return to work in 2 days.  O: BP 120/78 pulse 72 RR 16 T 98F  PE:  Cardio: regular rate & rhythm Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally in anterior and posterior lung fields Straight Leg raise: negative bilateral legs MSK: pain upon palpation over lumbar area with more pain over the left side. Slow gait, but not dragging of feet. Hip extension and flexion do not cause radiation or increase of pain. Lateral rotation of spine does not cause radiation or increase of pain.  A: Patient is a 28 year old female with no past medical history with lower back pain that is greater on the left and feels like a deep ache down the leg starting yesterday after lifting something heavy. PE showed negative straight leg raise over bilateral legs and adequate range of motion. Currently using unprescribed percocet and valium as needed for pain control and sleep. Most likely diagnosis is muscle strain due to negative SLR, age, lack of classic radiation symptoms followed by considerations of nerve impingement)  Plan: - Muscles may be tense, warm baths to relax, stretch if possible, do not do strenuous activity - Discontinue use of percocet and valium - Use NSAIDs for pain as needed - Recommend melatonin by mouth as needed for assistance with sleep - If pain doesn't resolve in 1 week follow up at clinic  - May recommend PT inclusion in plan if no decrease of sx  
2022/03/09 3:00:50 PM AST	152	Cage	Gerry Cage He/him S: Patient is a 46 year old male with a history of high blood pressure who had an episode of chest pain a few days ago when he was walking out of the grocery store with a couple bags in hand. He suddenly had a deep aching chest pain rated 7/10 that "knocked the air out of him" and required him to sit in the car for 5-10 minutes until it went away. He reports that over the past 4 months he's had this twinges 2-3 times that lasted a couple seconds and were rated a 2/10 for pain. These episodes only come on during exertion.

No carotid bruits appreciated. Adequately perfused. Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally anterior and posterior fields  A: Patient is a 46 year old male with pmhx of high blood pressure and positive family history of heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes and pulmonary embolism in first degree relatives presenting with increasing frequency and intensity of chest pain episodes that occur with exertion. PE was significant for elevated blood pressure at 150/92 which is abnormally high compared to home blood pressure of 130/80. Most likely diagnosis is stable angina due to history of increasing episodes of chest pain only at exertion followed by differentials of GERD, costochondritis, orthostatic hypotension.   Plan: - patient is very concerned about having a heart attack due to family history and may be willing to decrease cigarette use - smoking cessation review at follow up visit - add a beta blocker to plan - recommend increase exercise - refer to cardiology for outside follow up if patient is interested - f/u in two weeks  - track BP  - blood tests lipid profile, statin start

Plan:  - patient is currently not interested in smoking or alcohol cessation but would be open to receiving information about it - patient is open to starting antidepressants and receiving counseling - recommend blood test work up: TSH level, CBC (assess hgb for anemia) - follow up with patient with blood work results - refer to therapist 
2022/03/09 3:56:58 PM AST	152	Travis	Terri Travis she/her/hers S: Patient is a 60 year old female with previous history of high blood pressure and hypercholesterolemia coming to the ER for acute onset of stomach pain that started last night and has worsened in severity. She reports that it's a 10/10 pain level that started in the epigastric area but has spread throughout the abdomen. She describes the pain as stabbing and starting after dinner (she ate spicy cabbage and pork chops). The pain goes to the middle of her back and it hurts to take a deep breath. She denies chest pain, difficulty breathing, light headedness. No history of pancreatitis in the family and no history of appendicitis or appendectomy.  Currently taking metoprolol for high BP, simvastatin and benecar. Doses, route, frequency and reason for taking medications unknown. Allergic to penicillin results in rash. Caught up in gyn care, pap smear etc. Family history is positive for brother with coronary artery disease, mother who passed away recently from stroke at age 82 and father who passed away from heart attack at age 55.

PE is positive for extreme tenderness upon palpation of epigastric area and vitals are concerning for possible sepsis. Most likely differential is sepsis secondary to pancreatitis due to severity of vitals (hypotension combined with fever and tachycardia) possibly secondary to chronic smoking/alcohol use with less likely differentials including cholecystitis, appendicitis, intraperitoneal hemorrhage.  Plan: - patient's vitals are concerning for sepsis; start broad spectrum IV abx  - start pain management q6 hours tylenol with PRN oxycodone 5mg q6 hours if pain level 7-10 - schedule f/u for smoking and alcohol cessation as patient is interested in making life style changes  - schedule f/u for discussing dietary improvements (DASH diet)  - start .45 NS fluids - U/S abdomen for blood/fluid in peritoneum, inflammation fo gall bladder - KUB to assess any other abrnoamlities

Currently sexually active with one male and uses condoms for contraception but sometimes forgets. Does not smoke and drinks 1 glass of wine per day with her dinner.  O:  BP 120/78 P 72 RR 16 T 98F  General: young female laying supine on hospital bed, in no acute distress. Unable to sit up due to feeling dizzy Heart: regular rate rhythm s1 s2 no s3 s4 murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs: lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally in anterior fields (unable to auscultate posterior fields as patient was unable to sit up)  Abdomen: tender to palpation over lower abdomen, pubic area Gyn exam: deferred for physician Skin: pink, adequately perfused  Assessment: Patient is a 35 year old female with history of irregular and heavy menstrual bleeds, 1 previous miscarriage, social history consistent with alcohol use disorder and family history of hysterectomy in the mother, and transfusions in the uncle presenting with 2 week history of heavy menstrual bleeding, cramps and dizziness. Exam is significant for abdominal tenderness over public area. Most likely diagnosis is endometriosis due to heavy periods, history of hysterectomy in mother with other possible diagnoses including hemophilia A, hemophilia B, vWF deficiency.  Plan: - follow up with gynecologist as soon as possible to for exam and ultrasound of uterus; encouraged patient to discuss with physician birth control "the pill" for stabilization of periods (patient was amenable) - bloodwork to assess for anemia (CBC, hemoglobin) and infection (WBC) - recommend ordering TSH labs for hyperthyroidism - recommended decreasing alcohol use from 7 drinks/week to 3-4 drinks (every other day) -patient was amenable - f/u if symptoms worsen - f/u after gynecology appointment for discussion of plan moving forward 
2022/03/09 4:56:20 PM AST	152	Williams	James williams 5 day old M  S: James Williams is 5day old male born at term (39 weeks at 7lbs and 6oz) normal vaginal delivery with no complications; spoke to mother over zoom about concerns that her baby's eyes are yellow. Mom reports that he's had yellow skin since age 1 day and had an appointment 2 days ago. She noticed that recently his eyes also became yellow. Denies abnormal movements, twitching, poor feeding. Reports that he's breast feeding every 3 hours, taking vitamin D drops and making 6-8 diapers. The diapers initially were a dark black-ish color but recently have become yellow. She's also noticed that he "sounds congested" recently. Mom also reports past history of her being a "yellow baby" but does not remember why. Mom reports no fevers or difficulty breathing. Mom reports she's tired but doing okay.   O: -none Eyes: (reported via mom) yellow since day 5 of age Skin: (reported via mom) yellow since day 1 of age  A: James William is a 5 day old breast feeding male born at term (39 weeks at 7lbs and 6oz) normal vaginal delivery with no complications who is reported to have yellow skin for 4 days and newly developed yellow eyes discussed via zoom. Family history is positive of mother being jaundiced as an infant and later improving. Differential is most likely physiologic jaundice due to age, mother's history and lack of concerning symptoms with other possible differentials including breast milk jaundice, breast feeding jaundice.  Plan: - refer for labs CBC with differential: hemoglobin, reticulocyte count, bilirubin total and conjugated - follow up in 2-3 days to reassess symptoms and compare to previous visit as physiologic jaundice is self limiting - if bilirubin level is elevated start phototherapy to prevent kernicterus - (did not discuss with patient) potentially consider switching to hydrolyzed formula if elevated unconjugated bilirubin and normal hemoglobin, reticulocyte count (breast milk jaundice may be causing problems via mother's milk) - have lactation consultant present at next visit to assess if baby is latching appropriately and to assess if feeding is appropriate - consider starting iron supplementation if planning on continuing to breast feed after cleared workup and patient preference of breast feeding

Other items on differential include acute MI (more likely due to pos family hx and atypical angina presentation) and appendicitis (less likely due to pain radiating to mid-back).   P: Obtain abdominal CT, serum lipase, amylase, empiric antibiotics, CBC, CMP make patient NPO immediately troponin and EKG to rule out MI 
2022/03/01 11:01:03 AM AST	154	Abbott	S: Ms. Nancy Abbott is a 35 yo woman with no significant PMH presenting to clinic with heavy menstrual bleeding. She says she has always had variable periods, sometimes they are light and sometimes they are heavy. This particular cycle has lasted 14 days. She says she wears both tampons and pads and completely soaks through 4 of each per day. She also has associated lower abdominal cramping and bloating, rated at 6/10 pain level. Also endorsing lower back spasms with these cramps. She has been feeling light headed and dizzy during her periods. Her menarche was at 14 yo. She denies pain with defecation or pain with sex. She uses Aleve for cramping which helps a little. Does not note anything that makes pain worse. She is concerned because she has to travel to Nigeria for work in 10 days and is required to perform a 3hr presentation and is worried about how her bleeding and dizziness may affect this.  OBGYN hx: 1 miscarriage, no living children  Family hx: mother had a hysterectomy but she does not know for what reason. No history of cancer in her family. When asked about family hx of bleeding disorders, she notes her uncle had to have a transfusion but she does not know why.

2022/03/01 11:30:01 AM AST	154	Williams	S: James Williams is a 5 day old baby boy born to a primigravid woman at 40wks. His mom, Annie Williams, called the office due to concern for "yellow eyes and yellow skin." Birth was uncomplicated except for GBS+ mother who was treated with antibiotics. Mom noticed his skin has been yellow since he was born but noticed the whites of his eyes were yellow this morning. She notes he has had a stuffy nose since he came home from the hospital, for which she uses a bulb suction which helps. Otherwise, she is breastfeeding and he is nursing well every 3 hours. She says he has 6-8 wet diapers with bowel movements every 3 hours after nursing. She denies fever, fussiness, shortness of breath, cough, or vomiting. She is worried that he has lost a bit of weight since his birth and that her mother in law wants her to use formula.   O: Physical exam and vitals not performed due to constraints of telehealth. See HPI for ROS.  A: James Williams is a 5 day old breastfed baby born at term with no complications who presents with physiologic jaundice of the newborn, otherwise known as benign neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. His mother was GBS+, so sepsis is a concerning cause for jaundice in a newborn; however, this is very unlikely given he has no fever, he is eating, urinating, and stooling well, and his mother received prophylactic abx during labor. Other causes of hyperbilirubinemia - Gilbert's, Crigler-Najaar - can be considered but are far less likely.  His weight loss is normal, especially for breastfed infants, and he is expected to gain his birthweight back at 2 weeks.   P: Reassurance provided to mom that baby James's liver is still getting used to "conjugating bilirubin" which can cause some jaundice. She was given reassurance that this is completely normal and not concerning and this level of jaundice is unlikely to be harmful to baby. Guidance was given about concerning signs that would warrant an ED visit, including fever (ensured they have a thermometer at home), vomiting, increased fussiness, decreased wet diapers. Encouraged continuation of breastfeeding and not starting formula yet because his weight loss is expected. James has a 2 week well child check where we will check his weight and jaundice. Encouraged mom to call office with any questions. 
2022/03/01 11:59:25 AM AST	154	Smith	S: Mrs. Jane Smith is a 37yo woman with no significant PMH who presents to clinic with acute lower back pain. She was doing yardwork yesterday and felt a "twinge" in her lower back after bending over and it has hurt ever since. She describes pain as a "deep ache" and it is an 8/10. She says siting, standing, and walking make it worse. She has been taking leftover percocet from a family member which helped a lot with the pain and also took some valium from a family memeber to help her sleep. Those helped a lot. She has tried heat which was helpful. Has not tried NSAIDs or acetaminophen or ice. She is concerned about how this may interfere with work at Amazon fulfillment center where she is req'd to do heavy lifting. She wants something stronger for pain. Denies bowel/bladder incontinence, saddle anesthesia, fever, pain at night.    PMH - none, takes no medications FHx - noncontributory T2DM, HTN  SHx - works at  Amazon fulfillment center, 1 pack per week cigarettes, "2-3 drinks every 3 days", denies drug use   O: Vitals: 120/78, HR 72, RR 16, T 98F  Exam:  General: well appearing overweight woman, in no acute distress.

Skin: warm, dry  A: Mrs. Jane Smith is a 37yoF who works at an Amazon fulfillment center who presents with one day of acute lower back strain following lifting and bending over. Most likley lower back strain that will improve with time, NSAIDs, heat. Also on differential is herniated disc in lumbar spine given pain with bending over and worse with sitting and standing.    P: No need for imaging at this time given no red flag signs  Conservative management and follow up is warranted   Naproxen 500 mg, tylenol 1000mg, heat  Doctor's note for work with limited lifting
2022/03/01 12:27:37 PM AST	154	Cage	S: Mr. Gerry Cage is a 46 yo man with PMH of HTN presenting after an episode of chest pain after lifting heavy groceries. He described the pain as a deep ache, and "heavy" that "knocked the wind out of him." He needed to sit down and rest in the car and it went away after 5-10 minutes. He also felt light headed and dizzy during the episode. He said over the last 4 months, he has had a few seconds of "twinges" in his chest (less painful than this event) while running or walking up stairs but he did not need to stop what he was doing and they went away in seconds. He takes 25mg chlorthaladone and 10mg lisinopril daily for a diagnosis of HTN. No other medications.   Family hx significant for an MI and bypass surgery in his father when he was in his 40s. Mother passed away from a pulmonary embolism.  SHx: works in marketing at Capital One, 20 pack year smoking hx, 4-6 drinks per week, no illicit drug use.

PMI is size of quarter at 4th intercostal space at midaxillary line. No carotid bruit, No JVD, jugular venous pulse is brisk. LE pulses 2+ bilaterally. No LE edema.  Respiratory: CTAB on posterior lung fields, no increased WOB.  Skin: warm, dry  GI: no aortic anerysm or bruit   A: Mr. Cage is a 46yo man with PMH HTN, Fam Hx significant for MI in 40s in his father, 20 pack-year smoking history, and sedentary lifestyle who presents with stable angina. Other concerns are ACS but he is well appearing and in no acute distress on exam and chest pain went away with rest.   P: EKG and CXR to assess structural abnormalities Lipids, fasting glucose
2022/03/01 12:55:50 PM AST	154	Johnson	S: Ms. Carla Johnson is a 55 yo woman with no known PMH who presents with low energy for the last month. She denies lightheadedness, constipation, muscle aches, SOB, CP, weight loss, night sweats, fevers. She says she gets about 6-7 hours and can't sleep longer than that. Her husband has never mentioned snoring. A few times per week she has a headache in the mid morning. She has not been to a doctor in several years and has not yet had a mammogram or colonoscopy. It's been several years since last pap. She went through menopause 5-6 years ago.  Family hx significant for alcohol use disorder in father, HTN, and MI in father. Mother passed from chronic pancreatitis. Social history significant for 5-6 glasses wine per day, 39 pack-year history cigarettes, no drug use.    O: Vitals: BP 120/71, HR 78, RR 14, T 98F Exam:  General: woman with overweight body habitus in no acute distress, sitting up on exam table HEENT: thyroid midline with no masses Cardio: RRR, no m/r/g, no JVD. No LE edema. 2+ LE pulses.  Respiratory: CTAB on posterior lung fields  GI: BS+, no TTP   Psych: mood is "irritable and a little depressed," affect is congruently restricted, denies SI/HI, speech is slow and soft.   A: Ms. Carla Johnson is a 55 yo post menopausal woman who has not visited a doctor in several years who is presenting with 1 month of fatigue. Important considerations are malignancy (likely given significant alcohol and cigarette history, less likely due to no "B symptoms), hypothyroidism (given low energy that came on acutely with no inciting factor), and major depression (likely given significant alcohol use - could be substance induced). Anemia is also a consideration, and concerning given she is no longer menstruating; GI bleed would be most likely cause of anemia in her age group - concerning due to no prior colon cancer screening.   P: Given her lack of screening, it would be appropriate to get a lab panel with CBC, CMP, and TSH. I think depression is another very likely cause but we should rule out medical causes. If CBC positive for anemia, colonoscopy as soon as possible to assess for GI bleed. If TSH high, replacement with synthroid. CBT or SSRI for depression.
2022/03/09 10:31:22 AM AST	155	Williams	Subjective:  HPI - James Williams is a 5-day-old male who presents for a 4-day history of skin yellowing and new yellowing of the eyes this morning. He had a checkup 2 days ago in which the yellowing of the skin was brought up and they were told by their provider that this was normal. Since then, his eyes have yellowed, prompting his mother to seek care for him. The yellowing of the skin has not changed in character over the past 4 days. James has had no vomiting, changes in wet diapers, changes in sleep, or increased fussiness. The patient is breast fed and has had no changes in feeding pattern.

Meds: none  Objective: vitals not provided, exam not possible (Zoom format)  Assessment:  SS - James Williams is a 5-day-old male who presents today for evaluation of a 4-day history of yellowing of the skin and eyes. DDx - most likely physiologic jaundice of the newborn given no worsening of jaundice over 4 days and no change in behavior or feeding patterns of patient. Must also consider pathologic jaundice but this is less likely given no worsening of jaundice and no behavioral change.  Plan: 1. Mother counseled on normal physiologic jaundice and told to monitor patient's behavior and call if patient becomes lethargic or stops eating. 2. If jaundice does not improve by 2 weeks of age or worsens, come in for labs.

There is tenderness to palpation of the lumbar paraspinal muscles bilaterally and spinous processes. Range of motion is limited in flexion and extension, full ROM in lateral rotation. Neuro -> strength 5/5 in hips flexion and extension and knee flexion and extension bilaterally.  Assessment:  SS - Jane Smith is a 28-year-old female who presents with a one-day history of low back pain. Exam is significant for paraspinal tenderness and decreased range of motion in spinal flexion and extension. DDx - Likely lumbar paraspinal muscle strain due to acute onset during physical labor and characteristic pain deescription. Must also consider herniated disk due to radiation of pain down back of thigh.  Plan: 1. Recommended Tylenol and heating pads as well as Lidocaine patches and rest for the back pain. 2. Patient was instructed to return if pain acutely worsens or she gets a fever or increasing weakness in her legs.

Assessment: SS - Carla Johnson is a 55-year-old female who presents with a one-month history of fatigue. Review of systems is notable for depressed mood and decreased appetite.  DDx - Depression most likely given mood and appetite changes and fatigue despite adequate sleep. Must also consider alcohol use as a cause (patient is consuming multiple alcoholic beverages a day). Must also consider hypothyroidism (patient cannot remember last time she saw a physician). Must also consider anemia although less likely given lack of dyspnea on exertion.  Plan: 1. Will check TSH, CBC, and CMP today. 2. Will give depression questionnaire today. Patient counseled about depression and reports she is open to medication/therapy if that is determined to be the cause of her fatigue.
2022/03/09 12:26:52 PM AST	155	Travis	Subjective: HPI - Terri Travis is a 60-year-old female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and indigestion who presents with a 6-hour history of abdominal pain. It started around 10pm last night after she ate a late dinner. She then took Tums but vomited at midnight. The vomitus was non-bloody and was bilious. Her pain started around the epigastric region but has gradually transformed to a diffuse pain. It is sharp in nature and 10/10 in intensity. She reports feeling chilled and is diaphoretic. She denies diarrhea. Meds - Metoprolol, Simvastatin, Benicar (patient did not know doses), takes Motrin for back pain occasionally Allergies - penicillin (gets rash) PMHx - HTN, HLD, indigestion 1-2 times/week FHx - mother died of stroke, father had MI at 55, brother has CAD.

Objective: Vitals - BP 100/60, HR 110, RR 24, T 101.4F Physical Exam - Abdominal -> normoactive bowel sounds in all quadrants, diffusely tender to palpation in all quadrants with worst tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rigidity. Difficult to assess rebound tenderness as patient states "everything hurts." Tympanic to percussion.  Assessment: SS - Terri Travis is a 60-year-old female with a history of HTN, HLD, and indigestion who presents with a 6-hour history of abdominal pain and nausea. Physical exam is significant for diffuse tenderness to palpation in all abdominal quadrants. DDx - Perforated gastric ulcer is most likely given history of indigestion, chronic NSAID use, and pain starting epigastric and now diffuse. Must also consider pancreatitis given epigastric pain and smoking history. Must also consider food-borne gastroenteritis although less likely given severe abdominal pain and lack of diarrhea.  Plan: 1. Will get KUB to rule out perforated ulcer, if free air is seen will consult general surgery. 2. Will draw labs (amylase, lipase, CMP, CBC). 3. Zofran for nausea and pain meds.

No adnexal masses. Abdominal -> normoactive bowel sounds, tender to palpation in lower quadrants.   Assessment: SS - Nancy Abbott is a 36-year-old female who presents with a 2-week history of heavy and painful menses. Pelvic exam is significant for an enlarged and irregularly shaped uterus.  DDx - Uterine fibroids are most likely given heavy and painful menses and irregularly shaped uterus on exam. Must also consider pelvic inflammatory disease given no history of STD testing. Must also consider endometriosis although less likely given exam findings and lack of symptoms outside of menses.  Plan: 1. Pregnancy test. 2. Pelvic ultrasound to assess for fibroids. 3. If fibroids found, patient amenable to starting OCPs, although wants faster relief of her symptoms given she has to travel for work in a few weeks. 4.

2022/03/28 11:54:16 AM AST	156	Williams	Sub: James Williams is a 5 day old M who presents virtually with his mother for a 1 day history of "yellow eyes." Mom noted that he has been jaundiced since birth and it has progressed to where his entire body is yellow. He saw his pediatrician at 2 days old and was told his bilirubin levels were normal and his weight was acceptable. Mom feeds him breastmilk every 3 hours. She endorses good latch. He does not display hunger cues after feeding. He has roughly 8 wet diapers per day and has bowel movements with feeds. His stools were initially black and sticky, now they are yellow/green and loose. He has been sleeping ok and otherwise acting like himself.  Pregnancy hx: Mom is G1P1 Mom was GBS positive and adequately treated 40 weeks Vaginal delivery Mom and James are the same blood type  Obj: VS: none taken due to virtual visit Exam: James was not present for this visit  Assessment: James Williams is a 5 day old M with a history of jaundice who presents for what mom describes as scleral icterus. He has been exclusively breastfed and adequately urinating and defecating. Most likely diagnosis is breast feeding jaundice since he is less than 1 week old and has worsening jaundice. Other possible diagnoses are ABO/Rh incompatibility given neonatal jaundice (less likely because he and mom have the same blood type) and biliary atresia given neonatal jaundice (less likely due to regular bowel movements with loose, yellow stool).  Plan: Bring James to ER for evaluation Obtain total bilirubin, direct bilirubin Obtain weight If indirect bilirubin is elevated based on the nomogram, consider phototherapy. If direct bilirubin is elevated, consider abdominal ultrasound. Encourage feeding, consider supplementing with expressed breastmilk

Physical exam is not possible as patient is not present in the call. Breast feeding bilirubin and transient bilirubemia of the new-born are the most likely presentation due to presentation and lack of concerning symptoms like dehydration and lethargy. Breast milk bilirubemia Sepsis, or gallbladder/liver issues are lower on the differential as patient has a seemingly benign presentation.   Plan: 1. Call back to examine the patient  2. Bring the patient in-patient/ED to obtain bilirubin levels and consider light therapy

2022/02/28 10:40:02 AM AST	161	Travis	Subjective:   Ms. Travis is a pleasant 60 y/o woman with a past medical history of HTN, HLD, and indigestion who presents to the emergency department with 6 hours of constant, stabbing diffuse abdominal pain. She states that last night, she had a late dinner at 9pm, and shortly after at 10pm, she began to experience a sharp, stabbing, constant pain that was in her epigastric region. She also had an episode of emesis. She stated that she has a history of indigestion, and thought that it was that so she took tums. She states that they did not help, and her pain has progressively increased since then. She states that now the pain is diffuse and throughout her entire abdomen. It was during this time that she told her husband to take her to the emergency department. She also notes that now it hurts to move, and she feels better staying still. She notes that the pain radiates to the midline portion of her back. Nothing has made the pain better.     Objective: Vitals: BP - 100/60, Pulse - 110, resp - 24, temp: 101.4   PMHx: - HTN, HLD  Surgical hx: - Tonsil removed at 10  Social:  - Truck driver - Smoking: 1PPD for 45 years. - EtOH: 1-2 beers per night  Medications: - Metoprolol, simvastatin, benzacar - Unsure dose or why she takes them  PE: - Gen: appears to be in distress, laying on her back moaning in pain - Pulm: CTAB - CV: RRR, no murmurs - Abd: diffuse tenderness in all 4 quadrants, no organomegaly, no rebound, negative murphy, bowel sounds normal - Neuro: a/o x 4  Assessment: Ms. Travis is a pleasant 60 y/o woman with a past medical history of HTN, HLD, and indigestion who presents to the emergency department with 6 hours of constant, stabbing diffuse abdominal pain. Her physical exam is notable for diffuse tenderness in all 4 quadrants without rebound. Given her picture, it is most likely acute pancreatitis due to the fever, extensive smoking history, alcohol use, and sudden onset. Also considering gastric ulcer perforation, given the sudden onset and inability to move. However this is less likely due to the lack of history in the past.  Plan: - admit for in-patient treatment - High flow IVF - Lipase and amylase labs - CBC, BMP, liver panel, lipid panel - Tylenol prn for pain, moving up to oxy prn if uncontrolled - Zofran prn for nausea 
2022/02/28 11:10:26 AM AST	161	Abbott	Subjective: Ms. Abbott is a 35 y/o female with no past medical history who presents with 14 days of a heavy period, and 6/10 intermittent crampy lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back with associated bloating. Pt states that normally her menstrual cycles last from 5-14 days. She states that the flow is variable with some periods being light and some being heavy. For this particular instance, her flow has been heavier than it ever has been before. She states that she has 6/10 pelvic pain that is also associated with back pain. She has taken Aleve for pain, but she states that this has not helped. Her main concern today is that she has to go to Madrid in 10 days for a presentation. No associated n/v, constipation, diarrhea, or fevers.  PMHx:  - None - History of 1 miscarriage an unknown time ago.  Surg Hx: - None  Medications:  - Aleve prn  Allergies: - PCN: rash  Social Hx: - No tobacco or drugs - Drinks a glass of wine every night - Sexually active with one male partner. Uses condoms for protection, and occasionally forgets.  Objective: Vitals: BP - 120/70, Pulse - 72, Resp - 16, Temp - 98   Physical exam: Gen: laying on her left side, appears to be in pain. Noted dizziness during examination. Head and neck: no lymphadenopathy, eyelids not pale CV: RRR, no murmurs Pulm: CTAB Abd: Non-distended, no organomegaly, Normal sounds, bilateral lower abdominal and suprapubic tenderness to palpation, no rebound Neuro: a/o x 4  Assessment: Ms. Abbott is a 35 y/o female with no past medical history who presents with 14 days of a heavy period, and 6/10 intermittent crampy lower abdominal pain that radiates to her back with associated bloating. Given her clinical picture with the associated back pain, the most likely diagnosis is probably primary dysmenorrhea or endometriosis. This is explained by the heavy flow with associated pain and back pain. Less likely but still possible is ectopic pregnancy, given the stable vitals and lack of localization of the pain and also a missed abortion. However, we should rule both of these out. Her fatigue and dizziness make anemia a likely possibility too.  Plan: - Evaluation at ED given onset dizziness and weakness. - IVF, CBC to check for anemia - Pregnancy test - F/u with TVUS if positive to rule out ectopic vs abortion.  Noah Feld, M3   
2022/02/28 11:36:48 AM AST	161	Williams	Subjective: Ms. Williams presents for a telehealth visit for baby boy James Williams for yellowing of the skin and eyes over the course of 5 days. James is 5 days old after being born to a G1P1 mom with no past medical history and a pregnancy complicated by a positive GBS testing. Mom took no medications during pregnancy. Mom states that she got anti-biotics for the GBS, and she had a vaginal delivery. They stayed in the hospital for 48 hours afterwards without any complications. She states that at her 3 day follow up, she noticed that baby James had yellow skin. Her pediatrician stated that this was normal, but she states that now his eyes appear to be yellow too. She states that his energy levels have been normal, he has a good strong cry, he is feeding well, and he has 6-8 wet diapers/stools per day. She has not noticed any changes in stool consistency. Another concern that she had was that he sounds "congested" to her. She also states that his weight is down from 7 pounds 6 oz to 7 pounds 4 oz. Otherwise, he has not had any spit ups or diarrhea. She is mainly concerned about his worsening jaundice and if she needs to supplement his feedings. He also received his routine post natal care and now receives vitamin D drops.  PMHx: - pregnancy complicated by positive GBS  Medications: - vitamin D drops  FHx: - Mom notes that she was a "yellow baby"  Allergies: - None  Objective: Telehealth visit so no physical exam or vital signs.  Assessment: Ms. Williams presents for a telehealth visit for baby boy James Williams for yellowing of the skin and eyes over the course of 5 days. James is 5 days old after being born to a G1P1 mom with no past medical history and a pregnancy complicated by a positive GBS testing. He also has associated nasal congestion. Given his clinical picture, it sounds like physiologic jaundice is the most likely diagnosis. He has had no changes in activity or feeding. Less likely diagnosis are a genetic disease such as biliary atresia. However, given his nasal congestion and positive GBS, sepsis should be considered.  Plan: - Advise mom to continue to watch - Follow up in clinic if no improvements over the next couple of days - Regularly evaluate temperature and behavior, if any changes go to the emergency department immediately for r/o sepsis.

2022/02/28 12:04:27 PM AST	161	Smith	Subjective: Ms. Smith is a 28 year old female with no past medical history who presents to clinic today with one day of 8/10 lower back pain that radiates down her left leg. Pt states that yesterday she was with her dad doing yard work when she suddenly felt a "twinge" in her lower back with associated pain. She states that since then she has had a "deep ache" following with occasional episodes of it radiating down her leg. She has not had any motor weakness or numbness/tingling since this episode. She states that she has not had any MSK issues in the past and that nothing like this has ever happened before. Walking and bending over makes the pain worse. She tried heating pads and OTC medication which has not relieved the pain. However, she notes that she tried her sister's Percocet and valium and that made her pain better. She is wondering today if she could get that for her pain. She has concerns that she has to return to work in a couple of days and that the pain will not be improved by then. Denies any weakness, numbness, or tingling of legs.  PMHX: - None  Rx: None  Allergies: Motrin and codeine: gives her an upset stomach  Surgical hx:  - none  SOcial: - No tobacco - EtOH: occasional - Drugs: none   Objective: - Vitals: BP - 120/78, Pulse: 72, Resp: 16, Temp: 98  Physical exam: Gen: appears to be in mild distress, sitting upright CV: RRR, no murmurs Resp: CTAB Abdominal: no distention MSK: tenderness to palpation along lower thoracic/upper lumbar portion of spine. Negative straight leg raise test bilaterally. Neuro: a/o x 4, 5/5 DF and PF strength bilaterally. 5/5 leg extension strength bilaterally.  Assessment:  Ms. Smith is a 28 year old female with no past medical history who presents to clinic today with one day of 8/10 lower back pain that radiates down her left leg.

When he saw his PCP at 4 days of age she was told that his skin was yellow and that was okay. Mom state he is behaving the same. He is breastfed every 3 hours without difficulty. She does express concern that he will need formula. Pregnancy was significant for mom being GBS positive, but treated with antibiotics during birth. Birth was transvaginal delivery without complications or prolonged labor course.

Patient has not demonstrated any concerning symptoms per mom. Hemolytic could also be a cause as unsure what moms blood type is. Likely this is physiologic. Would recommend mom follow up in a few days with PCP for assessment of direct vs indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Return precautions to the ED including hyperthermia, hypothermia, low energy, difficulty feeding/ decreased feeding, vomiting, diarrhea.

Rotation without pain. No pain with straight leg test bilaterally  Neuro: bilateral sensation to firm pressure intact   Assessment Patient presents with new acute low back pain that radiates down left leg L>R in the setting of activity. Likely muscular strain vs sciatic nerve vs disc herniation vs degenerative changes. Due to location of the pain to paraspinal muscles on palpation likely muscular strain. Straight leg test being negative makes sciatic nerve less likely thoug presentation is similar. DDD could be possible but pain is more acute than chronic.  Recommend  pain management with prescription of Tylenol  heating pad decrease activity  physical therapy

Cannot rule our MI due to GI symptoms being presenting sign in many females. A viral GI illness could be present due to eating old leftovers, but no diarrhea and the pain is out of proportion to expected.

Full range of motion with back extension and side to side flexion with no pain. 2+ patellar reflexes bilaterally. Normal gait. No gross deformities of knees or feet.   Neuro: A&O x 3.   Assessment: 30 year old female with left lower back pain radiating down her left thigh. Physical exam notable for tenderness to palpation of left lower back, limited ROM with forward flexion but with negative straight leg raise bilaterally.   Most likely MSK muscle strain as she has ipsilateral muscle pain in her back and leg, is able to walk and has full ROM in all directions other than forward flexion. Also more likely given the nature of her injury.  Herniated disc also possible given the pain down her leg, but less likely given no paresthesias and negative straight leg raise bilaterally.  Plan: 1. Lumbar spine MRI to r/o herniated disc 2. Recommend alternating ice and heat packs over the area 3. Avoid heavy lifting and exercise (other than walking). Will write medical note to excuse her from her job as her work requires lots of heavy lifting.  4. Recommend Tylenol and will write limited prescription for oxycodone 5 mg for pain relief x 3 days.  5. If pain worsens or does not resolve in 3-5 days, RTC.

Social history: James lives at home with mom and dad, grandma visiting for a few days.  O: Vital signs: n/a physical exam: N/a  A: Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old born to a G1P1 mother who is discussed by his grandma today. She states that his eyes started turning yellow this morning. He was yellow at birth as well but this is the first time she has noticed the yellowing of the eyes. ROS positive for congestion. Birth history uncomplicated; significant for GBS+ adequately treated. Fhx significant for jaundice in mom.  Differential diagnosis includes breastfeeding jaundice, breastmilk jaundice, physiologic jaundice,  enzymatic deficiencies such as gilbert's syndrome. Most likely breastfeeding jaundice given exclusive breastfed, fhx component.  P: I recommended to James' grandma that she take him to the emergency room in order to rule out serious causes of jaundice. We discussed the spectrum of causes of jaundice including physiologic/benign causes. We also discussed the ramifications of jaundice such as kernicterus, which is why we want him to be evaluated in person. will follow-up via telephone later this evening with James' parents after he is taken to the ED.
2022/04/20 1:36:48 PM AST	171	Abbott	S: Ms. Abbott is a 35 year old female who presents to clinic with 14 days of heavy menstrual bleeding. She states she has a constant flow of bright red blood that has caused her to have to "double up" on pads and tampons. Her period is variable, with the shortest amount of time being 5 days. She started her menstrual cycle at 14 years of age. She has cramping associated with the pain that has been causing back spasms. She also endorses having clots pass. this started 14 days ago. The clots are the size of a quarter.   Medications: None except motrin for cramping, which is helping a little.   PMHx: none Social history: no changes to alcohol usage or diet lately.  Is sexually active with 1 male partner, uses condoms for contraception.   FHx: mother with hysterectomy a few years ago, unclear the reason. Maternal uncle waiting for a transfusion   O  v/s: BP 120/78 P 72 R 16 T 98  Physical exam:  Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2 sounds auscultated  abdominal: No bruises or ecchymoses on abdomen. Normal bowel sounds appreciated in all 4 quadrants. Tenderness to light and deep palpation in epigastric region.  Pelvic: Uterus anterior, irregular shape. About 10 weeks gestational size. No pelvic masses.  A: Ms. Abbott is a 35 year old female presenting with 2 weeks of heavy menstrual bleeding. She describes bright red blood with passage of quarter sized clots. Her family history is significant for a hysterectomy in her mother a few years ago. Physical exam notable for epigastric pain and irregularly shaped uterus at 10 weeks size. Differential diagnoses includes pregnancy (possibly ectopic) - this is the most likely given sexual activity, passage of clots, and physical examination with uterus at 10 wks gestational size  Other ddx include endometriosis, or uterine fibroids. This is possible given mom's need for hysterectomy (likely due to fibroids?) which has a genetic component.  Fibroids and endometriosis could also explain irregularly shaped uterus, hwoever 10 weeks gestational lsize points me more towards fibroids than endometriosis.    P: pregnancy test, STI testing pelvic US

PMH:  vaginal delivery at 40 weeks, no infection or NICU stay, mom GBS + Social: lives at home with mom and dad  Objective Physical Exam Baby not present, mom says baby's eyes and skin are yellow  Assessment 5 day old James Williams was born via vaginal delivery at 40 weeks to a GBS + mom presents with progressive yellowing of the skin since birth. Differential diagnosis is most likely for physiological jaundice because patient is asymptomatic and has been jaundiced since day of life 1. Must also consider breast feeding jaundice which is less likely due to usual onset at one week and no mention of trouble breastfeeding or breast milk jaundice which is less likely due to usual onset at 2 weeks after birth..  Plan 1) Baseline bilirubin levels, continue to track 2) Start phototherapy with eye protection 3) IV fluids to prevent dehydration
2022/03/14 3:02:26 PM AST	187	Smith	Subjective HPI Jane Smith is a 39 year old female with no past medical history who presents with 1 day of lower back and left leg pain. She says she was at her dad's house bending down to pick up debris when she felt a sudden pain in her back and down her left leg. She describes the pain as a constant deep ache and rates it at an 8/10. She says rest, heat, percocet, and valium make it better (she got 4 percocet and 4 valium from a friend) and sitting, walking and standing make it worse. This is most concerning to her because she cannot work at the Amazon fulfillment center without the full use of her back and legs. She has to work in 2 days and cannot afford to miss work.  PMH/PSH: none Meds: none Allergies: motrin, codeine cause nausea and vomiting Social: tobacco- 1 pack/week x 10 years; alcohol-1 to 2 beers every 2-3 days x 10 years; illicit drugs- denies  Objective Vitals BP 120/78 Pulse 72 Respiratory Rate 16 Temperature 98 F Physical Exam General: No acute distress Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally Musculoskeletal: Limited ROM on forward flexion of the back with shooting pain down back of left thigh; paraspinal and spinal tenderness to palpation on lumbar region of back; negative straight leg test on left and right leg; full ROM in hip and cervical spine  Assessment Jane Smith is a 39 year old female with no past medical history who presents with 1 day of lower back and left leg pain. Physical exam significant for limited ROM on forward flexion with shooting pain down left thigh and tenderness to palpation of lumbar spine. Diagnosis is most likely lumbar strain due to activity at presentation and physical exam. Must also consider herniated disk d/t presentation on bending over. Must also consider spinal cord or cauda equina compression but unlikely d/t presentation and negative review of systems for urinary or bladder issues.   Plan 1) Treat with pain medication, start with NSAIDs and consider muscle relaxants if pain not improved at follow up 2) Imaging not currently necessary

Need further assessment with labs, pelvic exam, and imaging to determine cause. Differentials include fibroids (most likely), adenomyosis, ruptured ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy.    Plan: -Check CBC, CMP, coagulation studies -Perform pelvic exam -Get pelvic ultrasound to check for any vaginal/uterine pathology
2022/03/09 10:59:42 AM AST	190	Williams	HPI: James Williams is a 5 day old who presents for "yellow eyes." The history was provided by the mother by a Zoom video call where she was present and talked about her son. James was born 5 days ago following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. He had yellow skin after birth and was discharged after staying 1 day in the hospital due to normal prenatal labs. He was not given phototherapy during his hospital course. He came to his pediatrician 2 days ago and continued to have "yellow skin" but was told that everything was normal. His mother called the office today due concern that his eyes have started to look yellow. She reports that he is breastfeeding and is latching on well, feeding every 3 hours. He is having 6-8 wet diapers a day and has bowel movements after eating. He lost 2 ounces of body weight from birth at his follow-up appointment 2 days ago. Patient's mother also reports that he seems congested but denies irritability, difficulty breathing, and any other changes.   Fmhx: Mother had jaundice as a baby   Vitals: N/A  Physical exam: N/A due to Zoom visit and being unable to examine patient  Assessment: James is a 5 day old male who presents with progressive jaundice since leaving the hospital which initially started on his skin and has now progressed to his eyes. Per mother, prenatal labs, including total, direct, and indirect bilirubin were normal 24 hours after birth. Differential diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia include breastmilk jaundice, breastfeeding jaundice, inadequate conversion of direct bilirubin to indirect bilirubin, hemoglobinopathies such as sickle cell. Breastmilk jaundice and inability to convert direct to indirect bilirubin are the top two differentials. Breastfeeding jaundice is not as likely as patient seems to producing an adequate number of wet diapers per day.   Plan:  -Have patient come to clinic -Obtain labs - CBC, CMP, total, direct, and indirect hyperbilirubinemia -If labs show elevated indirect hyperbilirubinemia, consider starting phototherapy.

She now complains of "deep, aching" pain in her bilateral lower back, more severe on the left, that she rates as 8/10. She also notes that it radiates down her left leg. She notes exacerbation of pain with changing positions. She took 1-2 Percocet tablets every 4-6 hours yesterday and 1-2 Valium tablets yesterday before going to sleep. Her biggest concern is that she wants to be able to return to work where she lifts boxes in 2 days.   Past medical history: No history of scoliosis Surgeries: None  Fmhx: Mother died of diabetes complications in 50's, father - hypertension  Vitals: WNL   Physical exam: General: Well-appearing female in no acute distress Back: Able to ambulate slowly with no gait or limp, tenderness and pain to palpation of paraspinal muscles in low back, negative leg raise test bilaterally, no palpable step-offs along spine or any other deformities in spine  Assessment: Ms. Smith is a 28 year old female who presents for low back pain which started after bending down and picking up heavy objects. Physical exam is significant for paraspinal muscle pain but shows no step-offs or deformities. Most likely differential is a pulled back muscle due to the physical exam. Other differentials which are less likely include fracture of a vertebrae, which is unlikely to no step-offs and no other risk factors such as osteoporosis. Another differential is sciatica, giving radiation of pain down leg but unlikely due to negative leg raise test and absence on bilateral legs.   Plan: - Prescribe a short course of muscle relaxants -Advice patient to alternate between applying heat and ice packs  -Advice patient to avoid strenuous physical activity and encourage patient to perform light stretches
2022/03/09 11:55:29 AM AST	190	Cage	HPI: Mr. Gerry Cage is a 46 year old with hypertension who presents with chest pain. He reports an episode of mid-sternal chest pain that he describes as a "deep ache and heavy" while he was walking while carrying heavy groceries 3 days ago which was non-radiating and lasted for 5-10 minutes. He also had lightheadedness during this episode and had to sit down and rest which resolved his pain. He notes that for the past 4 months, he had several episodes of pain when he exerted himself which lasted a couple of seconds. He also reports a feeling of "pressure" in his epigastrium after eating a heavy meal. He denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath.   Medical History: Hypertension, treated with Chlorthalidone and Lisinopril Family history: Mother - Pulmonary embolism in 60's, father - myocardial infarction in  40's and had a bypass surgery Social history: -Tobacco: Currently smokes tobacco 1 pack/day for past 20 years -Alcohol:3-4 glasses/week -Denies marijuana and drug use PE: -No chest wall tenderness, regular rate and rhythm, no edema swelling -Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally  Assessment: Mr. Cage is a 46 year old male with hypertension and 20 pack-year tobacco use who presents for mid-sternal chest pain with exertion. Vitals are significant for an elevated blood pressure of 150/92 , and physical exam does not reveal chest wall tenderness. Differential diagnosis of chest pain includes acute coronary syndrome due to pain with exertion and significant family history and risk factors of hypertension and tobacco use. Other diagnosis include costochondritis which is unlikely due to lack of tenderness on palpation and pulmonary embolism which is unlikely due to recurring nature of pain with exertion. Biliary sludge/gallstones are a possibility due to epigastric pain after eating.   Plan: -Get EKG while resting -Get labs - CBC, CMP, troponin -Schedule patient for stress test  -Get right upper quadrant ultrasound to check for gallstones in gallbladder

Other differential diagnosis for fatigue include hypothyroidism which is unlikely as patient thyroid exam was benign on physical exam and she does not present with signs of low thyroid such as cold intolerance, constipation, hair loss, and dry skin as well as iron deficiency anemia which is unlikely as patient does not menstruate and denies seeing blood in stool. Plan is to check labs for anemia, thyroid, and electrolyte abnormalities and if none, present, trial SSRIs.   Plan: -Check CBC, CMP, thyroid tests -If labs come back negative, start Fluoxetine (SSRI) and have patient follow-up in 2 weeks.

Mother states that pt had a normal delivery 5 days ago with recommended shots and screening tests. He had some yellowing at that time but did not receive light therapy. Mother is unsure what his bilirubin levels were. Discharged on DOL 1 without complications during admission. His skin continued to be yellow in appearance and mother saw pediatrician 2 days ago who reassured her. She is unsure if bilirubin levels were checked at that time. This morning, she noticed yellowing of the eyes which prompted her to call the office. Feeding well exclusively on breast milk every 3 hours. Mother denies any issues breastfeeding.

2022/04/05 3:02:03 PM AST	193	Williams	CC: "yellow eyes"  Subjective: Most of subjective was obtained from Mrs. Williams, the mother.  Baby Boy James William is a 5-day-old male newborn that has had jaundice of his entire skin for 2 days. He also began having yellow eyes this morning. Patient's mother denies fever, signs of distress, fussiness in her child. She denies rashes also.  Patient's mother is concerned that patient has lost 2 oz of weight since birth.  PMHx: Born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks. Birth history: Patient's mother has no chronic illness, did not use drugs during pregnancy. Had GBS+ during pregnancy, was treated for it. Medications: Patient on no meds FHX: no hyperbilirubinemia in family.   Objective vitals: not done (Zoom call) PE: not done (Zoom call)  Assessment: DDx: Physiologic Jaundice of Newborn-Likely, given how common this is in the general population. However, patients commonly present w/ jaundice at birth, and this patient presented 3 days after birth with jaundice. Given no signs of distress,fever, or infection, this is likely. physiologic buildup of bilirubin is common in newborns. Congenital Hyperbillirubinemia- Buildup of bilirubin can cause this, which would be consistent with jaundice. However, negative FHx argues against this. Kernicterus- On the differential, given his jaundice. Unlikely given lack of AMS and signs of distress. This is life threatening and very rare. Patient is unlikely to have this.  Plan: 1. LFTs 2. CBC, CMP 3. Potential phototherapy if indicated
2022/04/05 1:35:11 PM AST	193	Johnson	CC: "tired"  Subjective Patient endorses tiredness for 1 month, irritability, headaches (frontal, 1-2x per week for 2-3 hours), low libido, depression. Patient does not know why she is tired, as she sleeps through the night regularly. She has not been to a physician in years.  Denies sleep disturbance, bowel or urination problems, back pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, dysparunia, and shortness of breathe. She denies stressful events in her life 1 month ago.   PMHx: none, except "sinus issues in the fall" medications: allergies Past Surgical History: none Social History: 5-6 drinks per night, 1ppd since 16 years old. Married, good marriage. Has 2 children. FHx: Both parents passed away.  Objective Vitals  BP 120/71 Pulse 78 RR 14 Temp 98 F  PE: General: Mildly distressed. Lungs: Clear to auscultation Heart: RRR Extremities: No rashes, edema  Assessment DDx 1. Substance Use Disorder-most likely, given patient's heavy alcohol and drug use and positive family history (father was a heavy drinker). This can lead to many of the patient's symptoms, including depression, fatigue, and low energy. 2. Anemia-Possible, given patient's lack of yearly checks at the doctor, how common anemia is in the general population, and fatigue that is persistent. 3. Depression-Given patient's low energy, lack of feeling rested, headaches, and subjective feelings of depression, this is on the differential. However, the large substance abuse is more likely the cause of her emotional disturbances/energy deficits.  Plan 1. Substance Abuse Treatment Program 2. Check CBC, BMP, iron 3. Counseling that is substance-abuse focused 
2022/04/05 2:04:18 PM AST	193	Travis	CC: "stomach pain"  Subjective: Ms. Travis endorses pain for the last 6 hours that is 10/10 in severity. It began at 10 pm, was originally sharp, and is now stabbing. The pain, she says, was originally upper abdomen but now encompasses her entire abdomen and midback bilaterally. The pain began when she ate a late dinner, which consisted of iced tea, left over pork chops, and cabbage. Her husband ate the same meal and is symptomless. Endorses reduced appetite, nausea, throwing up once.  She denies CP, SOB.  PMHx: medications: metoprolol, Banacar, Simvastatin allergies: penicillin Surgical History: tonsillectomy Social History: Patient is a social drinker. Has smoked 1 ppd for 45 years. She denies other drug use. Family History: Dad died of heart attack in 50s Mom died of stroke 6 months ago Brother-> coronary artery disease  Objective: Vitals  PE Heart: RRR Lungs: CTA Abdomen: diffusely tender to pain   Assessment DDx: Perforated Gastritis-Severe, diffuse pain, fever, are consistent with this. Heart Attack-Given patient's older age, female gender, smoking history, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and FHx of early heart attack and other cardiovascular disease, this is high on the differential. Heart attacks can present atypically, with  Perforated Appendicitis- Fever, diffuse severe pain are c/w this GERD-Given patient's self expressed (but undiagnosed) reflux, and stomach pain, this is on the differential. However, her pain should be burning (not stabbing), and not usually 10/10 in severity.  Plan: 1. Abdominal Ultrasound 2. Obtain EKG and troponins 2. CBC, BMP 3. Start aspirin
2022/04/05 2:33:32 PM AST	193	Abbott	Subjective Patient endorses heavy menstrual bleeding for 14 days now. Her periods have always been irregular, occurring at 14, 21, or 28 day intervals. They are also light or heavy-very unpredictable. She denies vaginal bleeding between menstrual periods.   Patient endorses back muscle spasms, crampy abdominal pain that she attributes to her periods. Patient denies changes in mood. Patient is unsure of the last time she has seen a doctor.  PMHx: None. Patient denies history of uterine polyps, cysts, and other gynecologic issues. Patient has had irregular periods all years that she has menstruated. Obstetric History: 1 abortion Gynecologic History: none except irregular periods medications: Alleve allergies: penicillin Surgical History: none Social History: drinks 1 glass of wine per day. Denies tobacco, other drug use FHx: Mom-hysterectomy for unknown reason Uncle-receiving transfusions for unknown reasons Patient denies Hx uterine polyps, cysts, or other gynecologic history in famiy.   Objective Vitals: BP 120/78 Pulse: 72 RR 16 Temp 98 F  PE: General: No acute distress Lungs: CTA Heart: RRR Abdomen: Nontender to palpation, except in suprapubic area.  Assessment DDx:  Uterine Fibroids- Irregular bleeding, FHx hysterectomy, and frequency of this in the population is consistent with uterine fibroids. Uterine Polyps-This is less likely given patient's lack of intermenstrual bleeding. However, on the differential. Premenstrual Syndrome- Bloating, cramps, muscle spasms are consistent with this, particular if her functioning in day-to-day life is significantly reduced.  Plan 1. Abdominal U/S 2. Menstrual diary 3. Alleve q8hours PRN for pain 4. Consider SSRI prescription if PMS is diagnosed and NSAIDs do not provide adequate relief 
2022/04/05 3:02:03 PM AST	193	Williams	CC: "yellow eyes"  Subjective: Most of subjective was obtained from Mrs. Williams, the mother.  Baby Boy James William is a 5-day-old male newborn that has had jaundice of his entire skin for 2 days. He also began having yellow eyes this morning. Patient's mother denies fever, signs of distress, fussiness in her child. She denies rashes also.   Patient's mother is concerned that patient has lost 2 oz of weight since birth.  PMHx: Born via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks.  Birth history: Patient's mother has no chronic illness, did not use drugs during pregnancy. Had GBS+ during pregnancy, was treated for it.  Medications: Patient on no meds FHX: no hyperbilirubinemia in family.   Objective vitals: not done (Zoom call) PE: not done (Zoom call)  Assessment: DDx: Physiologic Jaundice of Newborn-Likely, given how common this is in the general population. However, patients commonly present w/ jaundice at birth, and this patient presented 3 days after birth with jaundice. Given no signs of distress,fever, or infection, this is likely. physiologic buildup of bilirubin is common in newborns. Congenital Hyperbillirubinemia- Buildup of bilirubin can cause this, which would be consistent with jaundice. However, negative FHx argues against this. Kernicterus- On the differential, given his jaundice. Unlikely given lack of AMS and signs of distress. This is life threatening and very rare. Patient is unlikely to have this.  Plan: 1. LFTs 2. CBC, CMP 3. Potential phototherapy if indicated
2022/04/05 3:31:40 PM AST	193	Smith	Subjective: Ms. Smith, who has no history of back pain, presents w/ 1 day of lower back pain that is equally bad with all movements (twisting, leaning forward, leaning back, sitting, walking, laying down). It radiates down her left leg. It was originally a "twinge" of pain that occurred when moving heavy debris at her dad's home yesterday.  PMHx: none medications: none allergies: Motrin, ibuprofen Social Hx: drinks socially, smokes 1 pack of cigarettes per week for 10 years  Objective:  vitals: BP 120/78 Pulse 72 RR 16 Temp: 98 F  PE: Heart: RRR Lungs: CTA Back: Tender to palpation throughout lower back, worse on left side Abdomen: Non-tender Extremities: No edema, rashes Straight leg test: negative bilaterally  Assessment: Ms. Smith likely has disc herniation, due to the severity of her pain, pain that is worse with use, and pain that occurs after lifting. Disc herniation-Most likely, given her constellation of symptoms (back pain that radiates down left leg). Paravertebral muscle strain-Likely, given the localization of her pain, which is moreso on her left lower back. It is also likely due to her lack bowel or bladder dysfunction, and how common this is in the general population.  Cauda equina syndrome- Very rare diagnosis, can present with back pain that radiates down a leg. However, it is unlikely given how rare it is and its ocurrence with bowel or bladder dysfunction, which this patient denied.   Plan: 1. Physical Therapy 2. Non-Motrin NSAIDs or Tylenol PRN for pain 3. Consider x-ray if pain does not improve with PT and NSAIDs
2022/04/05 3:59:49 PM AST	193	Cage	Subjective: Ms. Cage says she began having severe chest pain and tightness 3 days ago. It was after walking and carrying heavy jugs of liquid. It lasted 5-10 minutes and was 7/10 in severity. The pain did not radiate down her left arm and was not accompanied by upper or lower back pain, dizziness, or neck pain. She feels completely fine now.  Patient says her BP readings at work, which is almost daily, are usually normal. She is unsure why her BP is elevated today.  Objective vitals: BP 150/92 HR:85 RR:14 Temp 98F  PE: General: No acute distress.  Heart: RRR at all 4 locations Lungs: CTA Extremities: No edema  Assessment: Ms. Cage, with FHx significant for HTN, DM, and heart attack in her father at a young age of 40 years old, has signs in her history 3 days ago consistent with a heart attack.  Further workup is required to determine next steps in management. She is at a high risk for heart attack given her HTN, FHx, and recent symtoms of chest pain.  Less likely diagnoses: Stable angina: Heart attack like symptoms make this a less likely diagnosis. However, pain only with exertion (not at rest) is consistent with this. GERD: Less likely, although on differential because of her heavy meals giving her heaviness in her chest. You would expect to see burning also, however.    Plan 1. EKG, Troponins 2. If Troponins are positive or EKG is consistent with a STEMI, cardiology consult needed 3. Aspirin 81mg QD 4. Echo if #1 is positive
2022/03/07 10:31:11 AM AST	194	Williams	Baby boy James Williams is a 5 day old male infant who presents with acute sclera icterus.   HPI: History was provided by his mother.

He is at his baseline and feeding well (exclusively breast milk); mother denies fevers, additional fussiness, abdominal pain. He is making 6-8 wet diapers and stools with each meal (was brownish; is now yellow-green). He has lost a few oz since his last visit.    Delivery: vaginal, uneventful, born at 39 weeks  Pregnancy: G1; Mother was GBS +, given antibiotics; mother up to date with immunizations  Immunizations: up to date  Medications: Vitamin D  Allergies: None  FHx: Mother - neonatal jaundice, resolved  SHx: House 1960s   Physical Exam: as described by mother  Summary Statement: 5 day old male infant with a normal pregnancy/delivery who presents with acute icterus. Of note, patient is feeding and stooling/urinating appropriate for his development and there is no pertinent family history.  On the differential includes physiologic jaundice (which commonly rises to day 5 due to immature liver and increased bilirubin excretion), pathologic jaundice (as mother noted newborn jaundice but pt has been evaluated), or indirect hyperbiliruminemia 2/2 to genetics (Gilbert).   -CBC with bilirubinemia -if < 15, monitor if >20, phototherapy        
2022/03/07 11:00:19 AM AST	194	Smith	39 year old female who was previously healthy and presents with acute lower back pain.

Normal vitals with diffuse tenderness in lower back without notable trauma/lesions and negative straight leg exam.  This is most likely secondary to lower back strain due to diffuse pain with negative straight leg exam . On the differential includes spinal vertebral fracture (less likely due to lack of localized pain on bone), radiculopathy (less likely due to negative straight leg test)   -Conservative measures, with Tylenol  -continue light activity as tolerated without heavy lifting  -provide doctor's note for work for no lifting       
2022/03/07 11:30:25 AM AST	194	Cage	CC: Middle age male who presents with chest pain 3 days ago.   HPI: On Friday, pt was carrying groceries to car when he felt pain in the midsternum.

Pt has a history of HTN. On exam, he has elevated BP with normal cardiac and lung exam. This is most likely due to GERD (pressure on meals) and stable angina (CP on exertion and does not occur at rest). On the differential includes costochondritis (less likely given lack of pain on palpation), and NSTEMI (less likely due to not occur at rest)  -EKG in clinic today -stress test -famotidine PRN for epigastric pain -increase BP medications, lisinopril 25 QD   RTC 1 week

DDx 1. Breastfeeding Jaundice - lack of enzymatic conversion of bilirubin leading to cutaneous deposits. Most common in newborn period 2. Physiological Jaundice - most likely would resolve by 4 days of life, but can consider worsening by breastfeeding  3. breastfeeding failure jaundice - mom notes well latch and baby is producing independent urine voids so less likely 4. Direct causes (G6PD, RBC membrane defects):  consider if otherwise lab work continues, would expect family history corresponding with this.   Plan: 1. Obtain TCB, TSB and verify direct/indirect bilirubin levels to differentiate between direct and indirect causes  2. Based on results, can further pursue lab testing with G6PD panel, metabolic screens  3. If elevated beyond threshold of healthy levels, will need to use phototherapy for management  4. Discuss with family that this could be physiologic jaundice as patient is still within window of physiologic jaundice that could be worsened by breastfeeding due to lack of enzymatic conversion of bilirubin.  5. Possible lactation consult if not latching properly 6. Continue supplementation of breastmilk with vit D
