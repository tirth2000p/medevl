# Need to make the thingy ignore hashtag leading lines like these, comments are important. Empty lines should also be ignored, since they're there for style
# First seperate by newline for importance, then comma for item, then colon for alternative concept cuis
# For the less important ones, I'd like to do "points off- cuis and stuff in the normal format"
# There must be a space after the tag dash!
