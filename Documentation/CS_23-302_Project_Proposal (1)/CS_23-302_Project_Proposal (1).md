**CMSC451 CS 23-302 Software platform to rate clinical notes by medical students**

**Problem Statement**

1. Collaboration with the Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) and Computer Science to develop a software platform to rate the clinical notes medical students write while performing a simulated patient interview.
1. The proposed solution will allow the instructor to upload an excel sheet to a web application that will pass data into python scripts to check areas of the input file and ensure proper parsing of data to the NLP section of the script which uses MetaMap to compare clinical notes to important points mentioned in config file.
1. Based on comparison the program will give “PASS/FAIL/REVIEW” and reasoning for decision which will then be passed to MySQL database and will be available to the instructor for review before downloading.

**Business and Functional Requirements**

1. Client will need to provide resources that will help formulate final product design. The resources required are student medical notes provided by the instructor in excel format and access to MetaMap services for natural language processing.

**Stakeholders**

1. VCU Health Department (INTERNAL USE)
