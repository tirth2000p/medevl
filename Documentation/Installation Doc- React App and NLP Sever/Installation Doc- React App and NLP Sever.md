![](Aspose.Words.114a3623-7f01-4670-9350-1b6292243a51.004.jpeg)

This will install only the runtime dependencies for your React app, skipping the development dependencies.

*Note: Before running the command, make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine, and that you have a package.json file in your app directory that specifies your app's dependencies.*
