# *Software Platfrom to rate clinical notes by medical students*
## *Wright Center*
## *The goal of this project is creating an application that uses NLP which identifies specifice grading elements on the notes deteremine pass/fail/review*

### Collaboration with the Center for Clinical and Translational Research (CCTR) and Computer Science to develop a software platform that will use NLP(Natural Language Processing) to identify specific grading elements on the student clinical notes and determine the outcome as a pass or fail.

The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.
